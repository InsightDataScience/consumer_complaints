2019-11-15,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"","We have already tried to contact the company with the following complaint 3 times using different avenues. In the most recent email sent, we requested that they contact us to at least acknowledge that the complaint was received. We have gotten no responses since the complaint was first filed three weeks ago. The text of the submitted complaint follows. 

To whom it may concern : We are writing to submit a formal complaint regarding the poor service that we received while working with XXXX XXXX XXXX/Closing Mark Home Loan. We are strongly considering submitting a formal complaint to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and any similar state agency in Colorado and/or California, as we feel that there were instances that pushed the boundaries of acceptable and, possible, legal behavior. 
The entire loan process with this company, from start to finish, has been unprofessional at best to downright deceptive and, potentially, life-impacting. We have been forgotten, lied to, and put into stressful situations that, frankly, should never happen. We have been through multiple account officers and underwriters, been asked to submit documents multiple times, been told falsehoods, and, upon completing closing on XX/XX/XXXX, we received letters that appeared to be informing us that we had been denied for the loan that we closed on. 
The following is a summarized narrative of the timeline from starting the prequalification process to closing on the mortgage. This timeline has been compiled based upon timestamped communication ( both written and digital ). 
We started this journey in XX/XX/2019, upon starting the prequalification process. We submitted the requested information to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( herein after XXXX )  and promptly received a response on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, we received an initial workbook which showed us the expected loan amount, down payment amount, fees, etc. The individual that we started with was extremely responsive and helpful, answering any of our questions promptly and clearly. 
We toured the community and decided that it was a good fit for us. At that time, we were given the option of looking for outside financing options or pursuing financing with the related company, XXXX ; the related financing came with builder incentives. At no point were we pressured by the sales team at XXXX to go with XXXX. However, as we had already started the prequalification process ( and the subsequent hard hit to our credit scores ) and because of the very good service we had received to date, as well as the healthy builder incentive, we signed the sales contract with the commitment to pursue the mortgage through XXXX. The contract was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, following a discussion with both the sales team at XXXX and the XXXX representative. 
On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday ), we reached out to the XXXX representative to see what the next financing steps would be, as the sales team indicated that the mortgage company would reach out to us. The next day ( a Sunday ), the XXXX representative informed us that he would be running an automated approval and would reach out if he needed additional documents. We took this to mean that our application was complete enough to start the clock and was in process. At this point, we had not been told that additional documents would be required to complete our application, just that there may be a need for additional documentation. 
We did not hear back from the XXXX representative after that point. On XX/XX/XXXX ( a Saturday, nearly two full calendar weeks from last contact ), we reached out to the XXXX representative again. By XX/XX/XXXX ( Wednesday ), we emailed the XXXX sales team for assistance ; they referred us to the president of the mortgage company. We were informed, by the president of the company, that the XXXX representative that had been handling our application had abruptly left XXXX and that our application had not been passed onto another case manager/loan officer. By that time, our required loan approval date had passed ; this date was stipulated in our sales contract. 
We were connected with a new XXXX representative ( herein after referred to as new XXXX representative or loan officer ) who informed us via email that our application was incomplete and that nothing had been processed in the intervening time. Again, we had been under the impression that our application was complete and in process since mid-XXXX. At that point, again, nearly two weeks had passed, and we did not receive a formal notification of incompleteness. 
During the subsequent document collection period, the loan officer asked we could put down another half percent, which would increase our down payment to 3.5 % of the sales price. We agreed that we could afford the extra 0.5 %, but asked if she was considering an FHA loan. She informed us that she was looking at that option. At that point, we stated that we did not want to pursue an FHA loan, but said that we would consider it if we could see all the financing options that she could offer us. We asked that we be provided with a worksheet showing all the offerings that we could qualify for, so that we could pick the option that best matched our needs. We never received a product comparison worksheet despite the written request. Additionally, we did not receive an updated worksheet showing our expected costs at this time. 

Subsequently, as we were loading additional documents into the XXXX portal when we noticed that we had a loan details section available. We opened that section of the webpage and saw that our loan had been started under an FHA program, despite the fact that we had told our loan officer that we did not want an FHA loan and despite the fact that we had not been given a worksheet showing our product options. We communicated to the loan officer that we emphatically did not want the FHA loan, as the fees associated with the loan would negate any benefit from going with XXXX, based upon the builder incentives. Additionally, both of us have strong credit scores and did not need the credit support to qualify for a mortgage. Instead of giving us a workbook showing us our different financing options, the loan officer changed the product type for the mortgage to a XXXX  XXXX  conventional loan. Again, at no point were we allowed to select our product type ( or informed that XXXX only offered a limited product selection ). We were not given the information needed to make an informed decision. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the first set of loan disclosure documents ; we were not talked through our product choices at this point. We promptly signed the loan disclosures, after saving a copy and reviewing in detail. At this point, we received our first estimate ( aside from the prequalification estimate provided in XXXX ) that showed our expected loan costs, rate, fees, etc. This information was not provided ahead of time and we were informed that we had only 72 hours to sign the documents. We were not given options on product type or any other factor. Additionally, we were not offered any assistance in understanding the documents that we were given or any help working through the legalese. 

It should be noted that we were informed, only by the disclosures, that the PMI would not be cancellable due to rising home values. At the outset, the original XXXX  representative implied ( though, notably, did not explicitly state ), that the home could be reappraised after a period of time and the new value used for the LTV calculation. Under the subsequent disclosures, it was apparent that the PMI could only cancellable via loan payments compared to the original appraised value at closing. While not a major issue, it is notable because it is contradictory to information that we had at outset. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an automated email informing us that we had updated disclosures to sign. The email did not indicate what the changes were, nor did the loan officer notify us at any point that changes had been made. Upon reviewing the disclosures, the changes were the addition of a TILA form ( that we did not receive in our original packet ), an additional {$200.00} fee, and the removal of our {$5000.00} earnest money deposit. As a result, our updated disclosures indicated that we would owe an additional {$5000.00} in cash for our down payment at closing.

We reached out the same date to the loan officer and received a response that equated to her not knowing what was going on. Upon further research, she informed us that she wasnt sure why the earnest money deposit was removed and that she would make sure that we would get updated documents showing the amount. We were told to be confident that the credit would be given at closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we were introduced via email to a loan processor ( herein after loan processor or underwriter ; this introduction came directly from the loan processor and the loan officer was not involved in the introduction. At this time, the loan processor stated that our loan was conditionally approved, dependent upon two document lists. One list was to be provided as soon as possible, while the other was due within 60 days of closing. At this point, we were at about a month and a half out from the point at which we had been originally led to believe that our application was complete.

Many of the documents requested at this time had already been submitted as part of our original loan package or the subsequent package initiated by the loan officer. We had to resend many of the documents and enter them onto an online portal. 

It should be noted, at this point, we sent images ( pictures ) of several of the documents to the loan processor. This was not an issue and she did not request that the documents be scanned or otherwise in a different format. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we began reaching out to the loan officer to get information for the mortgagee clause, as our insurance agent was requesting it before he could start the formal application and estimate process on his side. The next day, we were informed that a new loan processor ( different from the current underwriter ) would provide that information to our agent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we reached out to the loan processor, as we had not heard from her since we submitted our documents ( largely completed in XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, she responded and said that she received all our documents that that everything looks good at this time. She said that she would reach out closer to closing, but did not state why. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the loan officer informing us that XXXX had acquired Closing Mark Home Loans ( herein after CMHL ) and that our mortgage application would be acquired by CMHL. The email stated that our mortgage would be redisclosed and that we would need to sign updated disclosures. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a notification from CMHL stating that the XXXX mortgage application had been migrated to the new platform. We received new loan disclosures at that time. 

The XX/XX/XXXX letter informed us that we would be receiving an updated conditional approval. This is a month after we had originally been conditionally approved. The loan officer did not reach out to explain that a new application had been started on the new platform, hence the approval process was started over entirely. The document informed us that our application was started XX/XX/XXXX, though it was not explicitly made clear that it was a completely new loan application and not just a formality due to the new system. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the formal scheduling request for closing, via Closing Mark Settlement Services. While this was scheduled, we had not yet received a formal approval, final disclosures, or closing instructions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received 3 options for the interest rate lock. The option sheet was sent only with instructions to look at Options 1, 2 and 3, with no explanation for the calculations, differences, or any other factors. Upon reviewing them, the only option that we could follow the math on was Option 3. Given the previous difficulties in obtaining information from the loan officer, we decided to lock on the option that we could follow. Based on our math, the other two options did not appear to conform to standard amortization at the listed interest rates, but, again, we could not follow the math. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received our updated disclosures for the interest rate lock. This disclosure, like previous disclosures, did not have any charge for points. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from the president of the mortgage company. This email informed us that XXXX was legally required to close out the application and that we would soon be receiving a notice from XXXX  that would show that XXXX  no longer had an active application in the system for us ; the email stated that the communication that we would receive could include language stated that the application was denied, but that it would not impact our ongoing application with CMHL. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a Changed Circumstance letter. This letter added a {$770.00} fee, amounting to 0.25 % of the loan amount, as points, as part of the origination costs. This fee was not explained to us. The letter stated that it was due to the credit report/credit score and credit report/mortgage insurance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email titled XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Conditional Loan Approval. This email included a list of new documents to provide, including new disclosures, new bank statements, new paystubs, insurance quote, and college transcripts. It should be noted that we were told, in the body of the email, that the documents needed to be provided asap. At this point, we were not offered a secure way to send our documents. We could email them back to the loan processor directly or fax them. 

At this point, we were also informed that we could not send pictures of documents to the loan processor, despite having been able to send images previously. While navigable, this put a fair amount of undue pressure on us, as we had to find a way to scan our documents to be able to send them via email. We also found that we had a significant amount of pressure from the loan processor to provide the documents quickly On XX/XX/XXXX, we received disclosures to sign. On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed the loan officer and asked if the disclosures were the final set and if the listed cash to close amount was the amount we needed to get our cashiers check for closing. We were informed that the disclosures given were the final set. 

The XX/XX/XXXX documents additionally included a waiver for the receipt of the appraisal within the timing required by ECOA section 1002.14 ( a ) ( 1 ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received the appraisal on the property. This property appraisal had been completed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we emailed our loan officer to ask about what name to put on the cashiers check for closing, as we never received closing instructions. While this email was sent on a Saturday, we had previously received prompt responses from all parties, even on weekends. We had no reason to believe that we would not hear back prior to closing on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We received no further communication from the mortgage company, nor any of its agents, prior to closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we closed on the mortgage. Our appointment to close was at XXXX. We arrived at approximately XXXX, as our previous meeting for the day had ended more quickly than expected. We were prepared to wait until XXXX. Our closing agent came out at around XXXX and told us that our application had not yet been approved by CMHL and that she was, as a result, still, waiting for documents. She also informed us that she had not yet received the final closing disclosure and that, as a result, our cash to close amount had not yet ben finalized. 

At about XXXX, our closing agent informed us that she had received several closing disclosures for our application that day. She then stated that the final closing amount had been set by CMHL, as she had confirmed the most recent disclosure with the wire processor. We were short on our original check ( which was stated as the final amount, as previously noted ) and were forced to go back to our bank. We had to come up with about {$800.00} on the spot to be able to close. At this point, our closing documents were not yet available. 

We signed our documents at our XXXX PM on XX/XX/XXXX. We waited at the settlement office until nearly XXXX XXXX for the final wire to be sent by the processing agent. We were given no explanation for the significant wait. 

After closing, we returned to our then-current residence for the night. We checked our mail. We found two letters which were mailed to us ( one for each of us ), which stated that our loan had been denied. The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, but had not been mailed and post-marked until XX/XX/XXXX. These letters were related to the hand-off from XXXX to CMHL. As previously noted, we had been told in XXXX that we may receive a formal denial letter, due to the new application being opened. As given by the discrepancy between the letter and postmark dates, it appears that these letters were held back for some reason. The reason was not given to us at any point in the application process. 

The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, we received an email from our loan officer apologizing for the delay in response to our question regarding our closing and a statement that she hoped our closing went okay. No comments were included regarding the fact that our loan had not been approved for the day of closing. We did not respond. 

In summary, the entire process was fraught and full of miscommunications and a lack of communication. Our grievances are summarized below : Our application was forgotten by the mortgage company, as the original representative left and nobody picked up his caseload. 
Our application was implied to have been complete and in process with the original representative. 
o At no point did we receive a formal notice of incompleteness, despite ongoing requests for information over several months. 
o We were not given a complete checklist of all the information that we would need to provide throughout the life of the application and approval process. 
We were not given product comparisons between available options, despite multiple requests for such information. 
We were originally put into a product type that we explicitly stated that we did not want. 
o While we do not know the details of the XXXX/CMHL compensation structure, we have been informed by multiple individuals from outside financial institutions that FHA loans often generate a larger incentive fee for the loan officer. We believe that this could be the reason for the initial assignment.

We were given contradictory information throughout the process. This includes receiving documents which did not include {$5000.00} in cash we had already paid ; while this was resolved, this issue was never explained to us.

We were not given explanations for multiple adjustments and changes to fees and amounts through out the process.

o Our loan officer did not make any attempt to explain any of the forms, procedures, or documents that we received. We were forced to make our best attempt at understanding the files that we had to sign. 
o When setting our rate lock, the loan officer did not explain the difference between the given options. As previously stated, two of the options did not mathematically calculate to the payments given.

o We are better informed than most consumers, as one of us works for a commercial bank. Even then, we had trouble with some of the documents and it is baffling that we received no guidance from the loan officer.

We were denied a secure way to send documents to the loan processor.

o Additionally, a format which had previously been acceptable for files, was no longer acceptable. We were not given an explanation for this discrepancy. 
We were not given closing instructions. When we reached out for instructions ( admitted at the 11th hour ), we did not receive a response. This is out of line with prior behavior, as we had previously received prompt communication even outside of normal business hours. 
o The response from the lender was given a business day after our closing. It should be noted that this response did not include any of the requested information. 
Our loan was not approved prior to the day of our closing and, in actuality, we had to wait for the application to be approved and for documents to be prepared and sent to our closing agent. 
o While we are not sure of the industry standard for loan approvals and preparation of loan documents for mortgages, it does not seem unreasonable to expect that the process should be completed well prior to the day of closing. 
o This caused a significant amount of personal stress, as our closing agent could not give us an expected timeline. We were left unaware of if we were going to be able to close on our scheduled date or if we would need to be rescheduled. 
This is significant, as we had already made arrangements for our moving process, including cancelling our lease with our prior residence, booking and prepaying for moving equipment, and taking time off from work ( including taking time for the day of closing itself ). 
We received a formal loan denial after our closing, with the denial letters being sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Given that XX/XX/XXXX was a holiday, it seems likely that the letters were sent so as to not be received until after closing. 
o The letters were dated XX/XX/XXXX, which means that the letters were held back for well over a month. While we are not sure on the required disclosure timelines for consumer loans, we have been informed that it is often 10 days from the decision date.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,327XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-10-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3416197

2019-01-17,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","I have been trying to get my Private Mortgage Insurance Removed from my mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX when my mortgage dropped below 80 % loan to value. Last year my mortgage was sold from XXXX XXXX  ( Under mortgage # XXXX ) to Ditech Mortgage ( account # XXXX ). I reached out to Ditech via a email ( after being told to do so via phone representative ) request to remove my PMI on mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX and received no response at all from them, I even checked my junk box and nothing was there. My mortgage papers that I signed state an "" Automatic Termination of PMI '' that states once my loan is below 78 % loan to value PMI will automatically terminate ( I have attached this document ). I reached out again today on XX/XX/XXXX to make this request via phone and was told initially to send the request that I already sent it too. I asked to speak with a supervisor and after being put on hold for about 30 minutes, I finally spoke to one. They told me that my loan to value must be under 70 % loan to value and that was their policy. After reading this document to the supervisor, I was told that "" they don't have that document on file ''. She ( XXXX XXXX ) sent me a link to send her the form I have. I did so and just told me that I'll be hearing from them in 7-10 business days. Given their past history, I highly doubt that I will hear from them. I did mention to the supervisor and ask her why they weren't staying compliant to the homeowners protection act and she said nothing. From my understand this act requires mortgage companies to drop off PMI once loans are below 78 % LTV and the loan is current.

XXXX XXXX must initiate the process of collecting the remaining {$.00} through XXXX XXXX 's bank. 

XXXX XXXX sold a debt of {$8300.00} to Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC. Certegy Payment Solutions has been trying to collect this debt since XX/XX/XXXX. Certegy Payment Solutions has also hired a separate debt collector, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is also sending letters trying to collect this debt. 

In summary, XXXX XXXX sold a debt for an amount that was incorrect in violation of the FDCPA. Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are trying to collect a debt I do not owe in violation of the FDCPA. 

I am attaching these letters sent by certified return receipt mail : -XX/XX/XXXX letter to Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC -XX/XX/XXXX letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
-XX/XX/XXXX letter to Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC -XX/XX/XXXX letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
-XX/XX/XXXX letter to Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC I am also attaching 2 additional letters received from Certegy Payment Solutions after my last letter sent XX/XX/XXXX. Based on the content of these 2 letters it is clear Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC has all the documentation to prove I do not owe this debt. They are now crossing a line into harassment.

-JXX/XX/XXXX letter where Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC is now requesting that I prove to them that the check I wrote has cleared my bank twice. This constitutes misleading and unfair debt collection practices since what they are asking for has not happened. The check cleared once, and XXXX XXXX has been paid. If the check cleared my bank twice, I would have paid twice the amount the debt was owed, and therefore XXXX XXXX would owe me {$8300.00}. 
-XX/XX/XXXX letter where Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC is ignoring a letter sent from my financial institution ( XXXX XXXX ) stating the check has been processed through my account. Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC has continually requested contact information for my financial institution, which I have provided. If Certegy Payment Solutions , LLC has an issue with the wording of the letter from XXXX XXXX, they should contact the bank, and confirm that XXXX XXXX has been paid.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Certegy Holdings, LLC",MN,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-12,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3149735

2019-03-04,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"","I am filing this complaint after receiving a letter from Chase today alleging a lie to cover up their illegal activities. In the letter ( see attachment ) dated XX/XX/XXXX Chase asserted that we cant consider you for mortgage assistance because we didnt receive your initial request by the required number of days before the scheduled foreclosure date. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE. I REPEAT. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE, AND I CAN PROVE IT! 
Chase has repeatedly made false allegations like this to us for more than four years. Most of the Chase Request for Mortgage Assistance applications we have sent to Chase have been ignored ( see attachment ). Nonetheless, In XX/XX/XXXX, our Chase dedicated relationship manager in XXXX, Florida spoke to the Chase branch bank manager and vice president in XXXX, Georgia. He ( the vice president ) told her ( our dedicated relationship manager ) that he personally faxed all of our documents to her the previous week and confirmed their receipt in her office at that time. In spite of this fact, she requested through the branch bank vice president that we submit our application and all required documents to her again for the 33rd time in 18 months ( see attachment ). Consequently, our dedicated relationship manager sent to our home address a XXXX envelope for us to submit our application and documents back to her again. We sealed the documents in that envelope and took it back to the Chase branch bank so that Chase employees could send it to her through XXXX. 
The Chase branch bank in XXXX, Georgia took receipt of our envelope of documents and gave them to XXXX. XXXX tracking confirms that our application was received by our dedicated relationship manager in her actual office on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( see attachment ). After that date, we never heard from our dedicated relationship manager again regarding ANY aspect of our application. 
Chase proceeded in XXXX to schedule a foreclosure on our property for XX/XX/XXXX in violation of the laws of our state for multiple reasons, including failure to provide proper notification as required by law. As such, this proves the statement made by Chase to us in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is a lie because we submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance application to Chase more than thirty days before Chase took illegal action to attempt a foreclosure on the date of XX/XX/XXXX. Our "" dedicated relationship manager '' failed to process our application despite our having previously submitted it to her in XX/XX/XXXX, and well as on 32 previous occasions in the past 18 months.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,GA,305XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3169014

2018-10-24,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Denied request to lower payments,"I purchased a vehicle 3 years ago. As of recently I've made every payment on time. About a year ago I went through a separation from my children 's mother. For custody reasons she has gone out of her way to destroy my credit and career, in order to win custody of our children. She has cost me 2 jobs, by showing up and harassing me. I have evidence of this. She has opened 3 accounts in my name. If have no problem paying these if I could maintain a job. My vehicle was intentionally damaged. Sugar was poured into the gas tank. It caused over {$2000.00} in damage. She disputed 3 payments made through an account that she had used to pay with. She was listed as on the vehicle account as a driver, and on the auto insurance, which she also disputed 2 payments. After which she reported to the auto finance company the location of my vehicle and said to repo it. Then bragged about lying and what she had done one social media. I've since made the repairs using what saved money I have. I'm having troubles catching the vehicle up in order to use it as transportation to an from work. I'm a XXXX   XXXX, and can make money with or with out a job. It's just she to the personal attacks from this individual I'm currently in a circle of dept that has locked my ability to grasp how and what to do to overcome it. I need advise or help. Recently I made {$800.00} in payments to get the vehicle under 90 days past due. Toyota told me they would give me options after I did that, and vehicle would be taken out of repo status. They denyed my request to move the past due amount to the back of the dept like they agreed. Then sent a repo agent to claim the vehicle. I denyed then the vehicle. And will continue to do so. I've worked hard to buy, keep, maintain, and repair my vehicle. I'm still behind exactly what was disputed. I'm only weeks from fully financially collapsing and losing my home and everything. I've exhausted all my resources to stay afloat. This is my first attempt to ask for help. I need options.

2019-02-20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"In XX/XX/2018 for about 10 months I made my daughter an authorized user of my account. Before doing so Barclay Card assured me that she could be a user and that it would have no impact on her credit. Only I was responsible for all charges on the account. She never signed anything. I asked for her to be added as an authorized signer to my account. BarclayCard sent her a card of her own to use. About XX/XX/XXXX she was finished with her need to use my credit card and I removed her as a user. 

She went to check her credit bureau the other day and found Barclay Card to be reporting MY full balance to her credit report. She called Barclay Card and they said they could not talk with her about it since she is not a signer on the account. I called Barclay Card to have it corrected and they said that I had to submit letter, via regular mail, and all of the supporting documentation to have my daughters credit reporting reversed. 

Their fraudulent mistake is not my problem to fix. Barclay Card acknowledges that they should not be reporting on my daughters credit report. They should not have reported it to her credit bureau while she was using the card and they certainly should not be reporting it now. However, they said they will maintain the fraudulent reporting unless I write them a letter with all the required documentation to have it removed. 

This is the exact kind of bullying behavior a big bank is supposed to have stopped a long time ago. So they have made an error and now it is MY problem to fix it. Unacceptable. And Illegal. 

Barclay Card has my complaint and my daughter 's complaint by phone and now through this correspondence. If they do not correct the erroneous reporting in a reasonable amount of time I will be forced to take more serious actions regarding the fraud they have committed against my daughter. Not to mention the illegal release of information about my account to her ( she should have never known the balance of my card at anytime, ever ). 

In my conversation with two Barclay representatives on the phone this evening both confirmed that the reporting should not have occurred as she was merely an authorized user with no responsibility for the credit and that the only way I can correct a credit reporting error, even if it is completely their fault, is in writing to a mailing address with supporting documentation which includes my daughter sending them, by mail, a full copy of the erroneous credit reporting. That exposes my family to unnecessary risk. The credit report they want me to send through the mail has all types of personally identifiable information contained within it.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,CO,801XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3156589

Capital One chose to place a stop payment prematurely on the check and in error, they will not admit to this error plainly, will rather state "" Expectations not set correctly '' as reason for stop payment. A second check was expedited via XXXX second day air and rep ( s ) did not allow enough mail time for prior check before reissuing and thus stopping payment.. The check amount, XXXX, represents the remaining balance in my checking account ending in XXXX. Replacement check was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. I left for XXXX XXXX on this day, was not at my address to receive/sign for it or sign check itself. 

XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX picked me up, drove me to XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have a statement from Mr XXXX stating he picked me up on said date and time. Please see attached document from Mr XXXX, he can be reached at XXXX. I was in XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. 

I received information from a XXXX with leadership team at Capital One stating said check was intercepted and signed by a XXXX XXXX whom does not live here, cashed at a XXXX XXXX XXXX which is not my account and do not bank there. A XXXX XXXX with Capital One has replied in re about this, stating the person, XXXX XXXX, lives at my address and the XXXX XXXX Bank account is or was linked to my Capital One account at some point. She also refers to a check deposited to my account from this person sometime ago. My account is now closed and It appears Capital One chose to close it due to account security, they saw the linked account, which I am not aware of, as a possible risk. It appears someone had hacked into my account at some point, added XXXX XXXX account and also used my account to cash a check in the past. Neither of these two incidents are related to loss of funds or constitute receipt of them. 

If Capital One will check signatures on check received on XX/XX/XXXX and replacement check delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, they will see signatures are different from another. Also, another check from Capital One covering overdraft and return check fees relating to stop payment shows my true and correct signature, as does the check received on XX/XX/XXXX which was deposited to my XXXX account and is now closed due to overdrawn status. The overdraft is a result of Capital One stopping payment prematurely as stated prior. I've requested Capital One check signatures, XXXX XXXX did not comply. For argument sake and figuratively speaking even if the person, XXXX XXXX, is related, does not mean funds were not stolen from me as they in fact were..

I request someone in office of the President look into this matter which has been ongoing since late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX. To avoid investigating signatures as requested, Capital One chooses to mark complaints as duplicate to avoid doing so. They requested additional time to reply to a prior complaint, which took over a month and then turned around, marked it as duplicate.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CT,06320,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3136706

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format.

They were saying that I owe about {$18000.00} and respond us back urgent. They called me mulitple times and send me a letter that if i don't respond back they will treat it as confirmed debt and will make me liable. I called them and nobody picked up and i left them 2 to 3 times voicemail that please send everything in writing do not call as I am practicing the Fairness act of Debt collections. 
Anyway i send them a detailed letter as followed below in text. 

Bilateral Credit Collection XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, RI XXXX XXXX : Account No : XXXX To Whom It May Concern I do not consent to this debt and I totally dispute the validity of the debt in the above-reference account number # XXXX and would like verification from you of the obligation, the amount owed, and proof of a detailed valid assignment of the debt from the original creditor to you. I request everything to be send in written format and no phone calls or text messages. Please send me copies of all documents related to this dispute including along with the following questions answered. 
Q1 : Who you are you? Who do you represent? provide me a detailed contract copy if you are representing the original Creditor? Provide the facts and proof that you are the original representation?

Q2 : What is your direct number and what is the actual company headquarter address?

Q3 : What is your professional license information? Also are you registered in Washington state to send the dispute details as per law? As you are based out of state most probably you have to take retain local counsel?

Q4 : What was your process of getting the debt from the original creditor? what detailed information you asked or obtained? What was your verification process if it was actually a debt or a dispute? if you did not comply with the law to gather proper evidence of the claim disputes, you are already violating the law time.

Q 5 : Before sending the verification of the dispute, did you really investigated on your side what was the core issue why this all happened? 
Q 4 : Provide all the documents account records, invoices of claims and correspondence on what specific date?

Q5 : How you come up with this {$18000.00} amount and what is the breakdown of these charges?

Q6 : Based on my knowledge, Debt collectors signed a contract with the original creditor either on a commission basis or buy the debt for pretty cheap amount? By law and fairness Debt Collection Practices Act, you are supposed to provide all that information? How much was the actual amount you bought the debt or dispute for? Is there any documentation/ contract between you and the original creditor. 
Q7 : How can you seek verification and validation of the debt?

I am also exercising my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C 1692, and demand that you cease all communication except with me, my family members and all other third persons. Also you have violated the law of Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, by calling multiple times on different dates to pressurize and threaten about the debt when I left a voice message and left a message to one of your agent not to call on my number. Please send me all things in written. 
You are here by notifies that if you do not comply with this request, I will immediately file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and to the State Attorney General 's Office. If you are not able to provide the answer to the above questions and proper researched verification of the dispute within 15 to 30 days of time then you are violating the FDCPA detailed Civil and criminal claims will be pursued.

I can not pay this debt as I do not consent and I do not validate this debt to be considered as a debt. I am already going through financial hardship, medical issues myself and for my family, and on top of this bilateral Credit collection continues calls and violated the law when even told not to call back that have put more pressure and created more stress environment for myself. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX They still called me and last time threaten me to take action against me and report my credit collection right away which they did not. About 2 to 3 weeks passed, then now i have received one more letter from them to call them urgently to resolve as they tried to resolve this case. First of all, I disputed and they failed to provide me with the proof and validity and their connection with the original creditor. They threaten me also voilated by calling me multiple times then it stopped but last time they called when i clearly mentioned al communication in written as my right. Then they started bashing out and said you are this and threaten to take action. funny thing is that there employees can not take control of this small small tasks, how come a company owner saying i am the owner and i do all the work lol it is funny to me, that means the workers are stupid and not capable of handling an danswering and resolving and seeing the case. Why the owner of the company will do basic paper work job and call like a customer service that is strange to me. They also have mishandling and putting false claims on other people and there are reports on betterbusiness burea. Anyway i have my proof of recording of leaving them message to just send everything in written and they still voilated it. Also I have the recording of the person who said I am the owner and i will report it right away and shut the phone and was not even listening.They need to know they have to pay for the compensation and my waste of time if they plan to drag it further.

You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance (such as perfect metro 2 format reporting) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates ,balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses , the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of it’s collection attempts and or it’s reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued (particularly for collection) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim(s) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA,HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA,FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.1) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff(s) {should I forward into a civil complaint} or with the entity(ies) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit(s) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging (or even unknowingly doing so) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers (or to-be plaintiff) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiff’s statement of claim(s) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accuser’s complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiff’s claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.4) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff(s) or with the entity(ies) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit(s) or derogatory claims of credit.5) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt(s), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim(s) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiff’s whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge(s) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff(s) does so unjustly, unethically ,and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not),both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff(s) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt(s) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim(s), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim(s), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim(s)....................",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,330XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-12-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3464108

I once again, called and talked to a representative over the phone. Same thing. They said it was taken care of. 
In XX/XX/2018, I finally went into a local BBVA bank and said I wanted to speak to someone in charge and find out why my payments were not being submitted and why the auto withdrawal was not going thru.

2017-04-13,Credit card,"",Other,"","I was stupid enough to charge some items at MACY 'S on my Macy 's credit card over XXXX. I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. 

I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. 

Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. 

I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would "" waive '' the {$4.00}. 

Imagine my FURTHER surprise when I received a FURTHER email from Macy 's about my "" account balance. '' I immediately called, went through endless voice prompts, and finally got through to a live human being who said in hushed tones that she 'd have to put me through to another department. 

Sure enough, I got the "" this is an attempt to collect a debt '' speech. The glorious XXXX, according to the faultlessly polite CS rep who answered, had failed to properly credit my account. He agreed that he could correct it and that my account would update eventually to show a {$0.00} balance. However, he was unable to reassure me that this, um, "" delinquency '' had not been reported to the credit bureaux that make a darn good living off selling my info, and he could not send me a letter saying that Macy 's had made a mistake. Given that the glorious XXXX had also assured me that I had a {$0.00} balance on my Macy 's charge card, forgive me if I 'm not confident that I do in fact now have a {$0.00} balance. 

I do not give a flying whatever about my credit as I am old and cranky and do n't need any credit. I DO care that Macy 's total incompetence and the Macy 's system that is set up to fail, to their benefit and to consumers ' detriment, affects kids and other people who DO need good credit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NC,286XX,,Consent provided,Web,2017-04-13,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2432795

If you have any documents that you believe authorized your organization to make the inquiry, I respectfully request a copy of it to be sent to my address so that I may verify its validity.

I have never received any contact or bills forward to me. Therefore I had no knowledge of any outstanding monies. In addition, my insurance company, didn't notify me of me having a co pay of a portion of the bill that had to be covered my me. Therefore this debt is a error and if the debt is my portion of the bill, why wasn't I billed, so that the matter could be taken care of, in a timely fashion.

2018-11-03,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"","I started a loan with with Ethos Lending ( XXXX XXXX, Ca ) on XX/XX/18 and had given them all of the information they requested and my credit scores were excellent that they used from a credit report done XXXX. Then two days before my signing date on XX/XX/XXXX, ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) they told me I would be charged a 1.099 % fee because my credit scores had dropped ( three credit agencies ) from XXXX to XXXX. I told them it was a mistake and when I called the credit agencies they told me it was because of a XXXX $ XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX bill that was unpaid. So I called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and found out it was not my primary bill, but a secondary bill from another property and they had sent it to the wrong address, not my current address they send my other bills. XXXX XXXXXXXX sent a letter out ( which they never do ) to all three credit agencies to negate this late report. Within 15 days my credit scores all rose 80 points to back over 740.  Well I signed the paperwork in the mean time and when I went back to Ethos they said they wouldn't rebate me the fees.. 
First I think when they first ran my report to see the excellent scores and approved my loan they shouldn't be able to change that and charge me {$4900.00} two days before I sign the paperwork, just to hit me up with another charge. 
And secondly when I show they the low ratings were wrong ( shown by the letter from XXXX saying to delete this report to all three credit agencies ) and then two weeks later all three scores rose to their normally high scores they should refund me the {$4900.00} charge because the ratings were false reports ... .. 
Ethos said they would explore this but just said well tough..",,ETHOS LENDING LLC,CA,93021,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2018-11-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3064962

I sat with one of the sales guys and he told me I was approved and that my loan would be for 2 years. I was so excited about this I was not even thinking, i was signing away paperwork. The bike in the dealer was in the amount of {$5900.00} with dealer fee and tag title, came out to XXXX. I gave a down payment of XXXX. I have had my bike for 2 years and I am still making payments on this bike. I asked the place Cycleone Financial,  where i send my payments when i look at my documents they had me sign a Lease document on a used bike that had 32,000 miles on it, on the paperwork it states it had 18,500 and that is wrong. When i am finish paying this bike it would total {$14000.00}. If i would have known this i would have not bothered to take the bike. This bike since i took it out the dealers lot has given me problems, non stop. I asked and i was not able to even trade my bike in for another bike, i wanted to because the bike was giving me to much problems, i was denied that opportunity for a trade in. I was blind sided due to my excitement, this bike is not worth XXXX, not even with interest rate would this had come out to that much. My bike has been to a shop over 6 times in 2 and half years. I take very good care of it, its a passion I have but all these issue is uncalled for. When i first took it out all the lights were coming off, I had to use my warranty for a starter the 1st year. Thinking it was leased when I found out you would think they would let you get into something else especially when they automatically put you on a lease without you knowing. the paperwork from the dealer itself has my sisters social.

The vehicle loan account is in me and my husbands name ; On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband went to apply for an apartment and was denied due to all the late payments that where on his credit report. According to the apartment complex, the late payments showed up on Transuion, XXXX, and  XXXX. These are the late payments that are currently on our credit report ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I contacted XXXX to get clarification on these late payments, because according to my documents I was never 30 days late. The first person I spoke with a XXXX   over the phone was XXXX and I inquired about all the late payments that were reported to the three credit bureaus. XXXX stated, I only see that XX/XX/XXXX, has been reported to the credit bureaus. Thats when I chimed in and said, According to the credit report that the apartment complex pulled on my husband, XXXX reported these months as being 30 days late ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ). 
XXXX stated that she has limited ability to see whats on my vehicle loan account far as payments are concerned. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor, and she stated should would be it will be a while before the supervisor would be on the call. I waited 30 mins before XXXX the collections supervisor go on the line. He introduced himself as XXXX the collections supervisor. I asked XXXX, could he tell me what late payments did XXXX report to the 3 credit bureaus because my husband had his credit report pulled by the apartment complex and was denied the apartment because of several late payments on his credit report, I explained to him me and my husband are both on the car loan. XXXX stated, I have limited visablity to you car loan account. I said, You are a supervisor and you cant tell me what 30 day late payments XXXX submitted to the credit bureaus. XXXX said, We report differently to the credit bureaus, for instance if it the XXXX and we havent received a payment by then we report you to the credit bureaus. I informed him that was illegal because by law you must be 30 days late on payments before you can submit it to the 3 credit bureaus. XXXX is giving me this illegal information on a recorded XXXX line. He instructed me to send a letter to the XXXX direct dispute department. After he gave me that information, I informed him that I would be submitting a complaint with the CFPB about these late payments and this wasnt the first time that XXXX  sent incorrect info to the credit bureaus on this car loan. 
Please remove inaccurate late payments for these months from the 3 credit bureaus ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Also is there a way from preventing the month of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from being submitted to these three credit bureaus Transuion, XXXX and XXXX.

In the listing it stated a model for i guess a replica watch, which if you look up the model name "" XXXX XXXX '' you can see it is a very high end, very authentic looking XXXX  branded replica which i did not know til AFTER this whole ordeal. I provided all this proof that i only received one watch, a poor replica, even sent this comparison pictures of the products and discover still went against me. 

ANYONE with two eyes and a brain can see these are NOT the same watches, i was duped, scammed, defrauded, any other word for a scam! These are NOT the same watches, i paid for a XXXX  XXXX, either way i did not knowingly buy a replica watch. I ordered two and received one. 

In the end, i filed a complaint with ebay, they voted in my favor and have the email but they banned me from ebay/paypal and while they told me i was refunded or would be refunded i never was. When i called them they proceeded to tell me they had issue in their system to refund my to my DISCOVER card and they themselves told me to dispute the charge and i would be refunded no problem. 

CLEARLY these is a problem, the seller sent a letter to XXXX saying a "" XXXX  XXXX '' is not a replica XXXX  when a simple XXXX search clearly shows it is, as well as the proof ive provided. 

the seller one sent me ONE ( 1 ) watch when i ordered TWO ( 2 ) watches. So even if Discover were  to want to scam me, i should only be charged 50 % of the total amount. 

DISCOVER has been trying to scam me for months, i have provided undisputable proof of the charge not being valid and that i should be refunded in full. I provided email of ebay awarding my refund to my discover that DISCOVER themselves asked for, now they are ignoring it when for months thats what they requested. Now they are attempting to take money from me over a cheap, counterfeit XXXX.

Each time Experian states they have investigated the issue but have never provided any information related to how the information has been verified. 

Moreover, per the attachment to this complaint Experian has stated that since I have "" previously disputed this item. We are not required to process a duplicative dispute. If you have new or different information relevant to your dispute ''. I believe this is a direct violation of the regulations related to the reinvestigation of a dispute, specifically, [ 15 U.S.C. 1681i ], Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - In general. Subject to subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 

By letter dated XX/XX/2018 ( Attached ) and a three subsequent letters dated XX/XX/2018 ( also attached, USPS tracking, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) I have asked for information pertaining to the verification of these items.I have yet to receive any thing other than a generic reply letter explaining the debt has been verified. I am once again asking that Experian reinvestigate the dispute and provide the specific information pertaining to the verification and how they verified the information. 

Finally, I was able to have the information updated on the other two major credit bureaus very recently and I am unsure why Experian continues to send "" form '' letters back to me without a reasonable explanation or specific information related to the "" investigation '' of my dispute.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,MD,20720,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3105739

I looked at my credit report in the last year and saw that this account was still open, so then I launched an investigation via my credit bureau to look into why this account was open, but did not get an answer. This really caught my attention when my tax refund was taken by this company.

2019-01-16,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from chase stating that they are reporting my Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) as charged off on XX/XX/XXXX with unpaid balance of {$24000.00}.

They stated they canceled the balance owed on XX/XX/XXXX and issued a XXXX. and as a result updated charge off balance to {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and reported to credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX.

Further they state they carefully reviewed the account and did not find any misrepresentations, unfair tactics or tried to be deceiving.

And that they are required to report accurately.

The problem with these statements are my credit report shows a charge off in the payment history on XX/XX/XXXX. Then the next data entry shows a charge off on XX/XX/XXXX.

The status shows a balance update and status of charge off update to be XX/XX/XXXX when they clearly said in the letter the balance was canceled on XX/XX/XXXX. If the balance is {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX it should state XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX.

The next problem is the XXXX they furnished in the letter and sent to the irs shows an identifiable event code of ( F ) By Agreement. This would have to mean that I made an agreement with them to cancel the debt owed for less than the full balance. This would be false.

The date of the Identifiable event is XX/XX/XXXX. Considering the Irs regulations prior to XX/XX/XXXX. If a debt has not been paid for 36 months and active collection is not pursued then a XXXX is to be issued even if the debt is not discharged. The account was delinquent prior to XX/XX/XXXX and closed and charged off XX/XX/XXXX. A XXXX should have been issued prior to XX/XX/XXXX. So in this case the XXXX was issued in the wrong year with incorrect event coding Finally according to XXXX  county land records there was a mortgage assignment filed for this account. The Assignment of mortgage was not to Chase Home Finance nor Chase Home Lending. Which gives reason to believe the incorrect creditor is reporting the debt and that they do not have a valid claim. Whether the Assignment of mortgage is valid is speculative considering the notary had been suspended and the agent on behalf of Chase may or may not have worked for Chase.

My actions have been contacting Chase about the misrepresentations and they have stated the account has been charged off since XX/XX/XXXXbut it is still open and they are reporting correctly.

I disputed with Credit Reporting Agencies to validate the information which is clearly incorrect. The came back that they only report what they are told to and that it was validated.

I have submitted a prior complaint to CFPB which contacted Chase which responded with the letter that I have explained.

I have continually ran into problems getting credit due to this account reporting the charge off as XX/XX/XXXX since Derogatory Credit waiting periods require 4 years though the Charge Off had occurred XX/XX/XXXX. The cancellation of debt was XX/XX/XXXX which is not a charge off especially if the account was already charged off.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,IL,601XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-16,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3126827

2019-01-07,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"During several dates, I have sent certified mail to the credit bureaus asking them to verify the inaccuracies of the information on the bankruptcy they are reporting. On my report, it lists the liabilities and assets being {$0.00}. This is not accurate and you can see this highlighted on the report attached. On several dates, I received the response from the bureau stating they verified the information. I then sent a letter to the XXXX County Court Clerk 's office asking if they verified the information to the bureaus. They sent me a letter stating that they do not provide information to the bureaus. The XXXX creditor was sent a letter for verification and validation and they have not responded to my request and have exceeded the mandatory 30 day time limit. XXXX XXXX was also contacted and has not sent verification.

My complaint is this, I challenged the Items based upon the inaccurate reporting of the {$0.00} assets and {$0.00} Liabilities on my report for the BK. Pertaining to the XXXX account, they have not responded to certified mail and confirmed verification and validation of their inaccurate reporting. The XXXX XXXX account jumps instantly into 60 day late reporting mark but does not say a 30 day period was breached. I have also added proof that these bureaus are not doing a true verification and supplying relevant proof while not flippantly dismissing the FCRA mandated rules. The bureaus also refuse to provide and form of evidence there for proving their verification. The Bureaus claimed that they had verified the information, when clearly they could not have for two reasons for the BK, 1 ) it is impossible to have a bankruptcy and have {$0.00} liabilities and {$0.00} assets reported 2 ) the bureaus claimed they verified the information, yet the source of the information sent me a letter that they do not verify information with the courts. Also, I put a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX report yet they used that agency ( NO third party can verify per FCRA ) as a third party.

This leads me to conclude that the credit bureaus never conducted a reasonable investigation on this inaccurate information for the BK. For the XXXX account they have not responded to my request for validation and verification and time has lapsed past 30 days.

In my certified mail I also requested they remove any inquiries that are not currently associated to any account. The credit bureaus also said they verified the information but can't provide any proof. If they do have proof they have not provided that to me after many requests.

I would like to have this inaccurate records removed from my credit report as it is reporting inaccurately and incomplete on my report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,TX,761XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-07,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3118512

Unbeknownst to me, the representative I had spoken to reversed my entire XXXX mortgage payment instead of just crediting me the {$7.00} that was erroneously taken out of my checking account. Upon attending our closing, and our title closer speaking with the representative from XXXX XXXX and receiving the closing figures, we successfully concluded our closing thinking everything was fine. A month later I received a notice from XXXX XXXX advising we were in arrears in our mortgage payment. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX explaining that we had closed that account on XX/XX/18. They advised that they indeed saw the money for the pay-off of the mortgage however it was being held in a suspense account pending further investigation. I told them to expeditiously examine the issue and get back to me asap. After not hearing from them for over a week, I called the servicing center and spoke to an agent that informed me I owed them {$2000.00} for XXXX mortgage payment. I said that was incorrect as I was enrolled in EFT which automatically pays my mortgage. I was then apprised with the fact that XXXX XXXX had reversed the entire mortgage payment for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX instead of crediting me the {$7.00} I had requested. I told them at no time was I EVER made aware that the entire XXXX payment was being reversed as I would not have allowed that to happen. They told me they would "" look into this ''. I also advised them that THEIR AGENT gave the figures at the closing on XX/XX/XXXX which indicated that XXXX XXXX knew the payment was reversed and should have included that in the closing numbers. I then went back and forth with XXXX XXXX for several weeks regarding this disaster speaking with agent after agent and vehemently demanded that no action be taken with any credit agency until AFTER a full investigation of the issue was resolved as this was surely the fault of XXXX XXXX. I was assured by a supervisor at XXXX XXXX that indeed no action would be taken. In XXXX, I was notified by the credit agencies that our credit score had dropped over 200 points due to late payments on our mortgage! I again contacted XXXX XXXX demanding they reverse this negative report only to be told they can not. I am sure you know that a negative report against a mortgage is a killer to your credit.

2019-03-08,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","Due to the defective escrow calculations in my mortgage, the lender increased my monthly payments by {$450.00} a month, beyond what I can afford. To correct this problem I am attempting to refinance my mortgage since the six month waiting period mandated by FHA has expired. This refinance is time sensitive as it has to be complete before the lender pays the next property tax bill this month which puts the escrow account into a negative balance. 

To make this happen correctly, I contacted Plaza to get the automatic draft of the mortgage payment from my bank account stopped and the tax payment delayed. I was assured both verbally and in writing that both of those things had been done, yet Plaza still drafted the payment out of my bank account. This has put the brakes on my refinance as it has totally changed the payoff amounts and affected closing costs.

I have been in contact with Plaza several times over the last two days since they did this and am getting nothing but run around. They promise calls back that never come and can not provide any explanation at all as to why they can not just fix their mistake.

This complaint involves the following GR employees XXXX XXXX ( VP of Mortgage Lending ) ( "" XXXX '' ), XXXX XXXX ( Loan Coordinator ) ( "" XXXX '' ), and XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) ( Production Manager ). 

After a number of other mishaps during the pre-closing process, we were first told that XXXX finally submitted our application to the real lender this past Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). We were scheduled to close today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Despite assuring us on Friday that we were "" on track '' to close on time, XXXX and XXXX failed to disclose of mistakes delaying our close. They then failed to answer direct questions -- on Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday -- about when documents were sent so that we could evaluated whether closing needed to be moved and seek and extension from the sellers. Finally, at XXXX Wednesday XXXX -- hours before we were scheduled to close -- XXXX told me via a phone call that XXXX had mistakenly sent documentation to XXXX rather than the investor, XXXX XXXX, and that it lead to the delay. She then promised to provide me details in writing by the next morning so that I could assuage the sellers ' concerns and obtain an extension. 

On Thursday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a call from XXXX informing me that the information provided by XXXX -- which I had shared with the sellers as we tried to work towards delaying the closing at the last minute -- was incorrect. In fact, no information had been sent to XXXX. Rather, when the XXXX XXXX underwriter had returned the file to GR on XX/XX/XXXX, it had done so with a direction that the property appraisal be sent to collateral underwriting. GR ignored that direction until it finally sent the appraisal over to collateral review on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. This was not disclosed to us until my call with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 

On that same call, XXXX assured me that there would only be a 3-4 hour turnaround once approval from XXXX XXXX was received because our filed would be in "" rush '' protocol for GR. Coincidentally, XXXX XXXX sent over approval by collateral review just after our call, around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX left me a voicemail that afternoon indicating they had received approval and would "" work on a closing for tomorrow on a rush. '' Despite those promises, as of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX the file is still "" in line '' to be reviewed by underwriting. The sellers are now threatening not to extend the contract. XXXX is backtracking on his promises yesterday, saying in a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX e-mail to me that "" I never once said we were closing today.

2019-05-19,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"In addition to my TEACH Grants being wrongfully converted to loans in XXXX of XXXX, my loans have now been turned over to the US Department of Education for default. I am NOT in default. According to the most recent escalated rep that I spoke with on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were put in default on XX/XX/XXXX as a result of an error on their behalf. As XXXX, an escalated rep in the XXXX XXXX explained, the method by which they refunded money to me for payments made to grants, threw my loans into default. As she explained on XX/XX/XXXX, this is "" A big mess '', and it is by no fault of yours. '' I understand that the loans now must go to the "" XXXX XXXX '' and there is no timeline for the "" mess '' to be corrected. Meanwhile, my credit is trashed, and there is no estimated timeline that can be provided to me for the correction to occur. 
The numerous reps that I have spoken with since XXXX regarding my grants, Income-driven payment request, and public loan forgiveness program, have all given me contradictory information, and I have no faith in anyone I speak with there regarding my status on any of the above listed processes. For example, in XXXX, I had an escalated rep guide me through the Income-driven repayment application, wait on the phone until I completed the application, and uploaded to my online account. The next time I spoke with them regarding my expected refund for grant payments, I was told that the refund would not be issued, and that the payments would be credited to the overall loan amount. Yet, I was told in XXXX that I would be receiving a check by XX/XX/XXXX. During that same conversation, I took the opportunity to explain how I was exhausted from having to make numerous calls that usually exceeded 40 minutes, only to have to start over explaining the issues and repeating what I had been told on the previous conversation. Consistently, I was told that I was given incorrect information by previous rep. If it were not the truth, and if it did not cause stress, it would be comical - like a XXXX XXXX XXXX skit. Every rep provided different information regarding the same topic, even among escalated reps ( that I demanded to deal with every call since XXXX ). I complained about how it took 45 minutes and an escalated rep to teach me how to complete my IDR request so that I was not overcharged, and how upset I was that I had paid excessive payments for years because the application did not allow for me to correctly document my financial situation. In other words, I told the rep that the application "" baits '' you in to documenting income and spouse information that is not correct, but you are scared not to document it like that because of the liability you are subject to for filing false information. I told him how thankful I was that 5 years in to filing IDRs and making payments, someone was competent enough, and cared enough, to guide me through the application to get payment lowered where it should be. When I described that situation, the representative said that my IDR request provided "" false '' information, and that it could get me in trouble! I explained again that an escalated rep walked me through it, and waited on the phone for me to upload it and it be received. He said he can see where that happened, but unfortunately the rep gave me incorrect information. He said I could keep the payment where it is for now, but that I would have to file it differently if my husband and I file taxes jointly. 
There are many more occasions in which I have been provided false information and guidance, including information regarding the XXXX program. Obviously, Fed Loan Servicing reps have no accountability, and/or competence regarding protocols in any department. I have managed to get through, and have coped with the undue stress and excessive time and aggravation involved in managing my student loans, but default, I can not deal with! This is unbearable, and is negatively affecting my health. I am seeking legal advice. Thankfully, I have documented my calls since XXXX, with employee ID numbers. 
I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have worked at the same school, in the same position for 10 years. I pay my bills and am a law abiding citizen. Please advise.",,AES/PHEAA,AL,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3247132

I am sending this letter as of my final attempt to fairly allow you to do your job and kindly remove the errors that are reporting on my credit report. I've mentioned that i am a victim of identity theft. My information was also leaked in several breaches over the years but a recent one a few weeks in XXXX of 2019. Since it comes to my attention that you aren't responding maybe we should settle in court, which will work for me and i won't be wasting my time.

This letter is being sent to you in response to a computer generated, unsigned letter dated XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX ), letter received by Claimant from your offices. Be advised that your claim is disputed and validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt is requested in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692 and as amended by adding the following new Title 8 USC 802 et seq., and the Fair Credit Billing Act, 15 USC. 1666 et seq. All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq. It is not now, nor has it ever been, my intention to avoid paying any obligation that is lawfully owed by the Claimant. In order to make arrangements to pay an obligation which may be lawfully owed, please document and verify the debt by complying, in good faith, with this request for validation and return it to me, within thirty ( 30 ) days of receipt of this letter. 
This is NOT a request for verification or proof of Claimant mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION and PROOF OF CLAIM made pursuant to the above named Titles and Sections. I respectfully request that your offices provide Claimant with competent evidence as per the attached Declaration and Proof of Claim that I have any legal obligation to pay you the unsubstantiated alleged debt. Furthermore you shall cease all verbal communication. No phone calls to the Claimant. 
At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus, such as, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX prior to validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt, this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact ; if any negative mark is found on any of Claimant credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Violation of United States Code TITLE 18 PART 1 CHAPTER 63 1341 ( Mail Fraud ) This debt is considered to be invalid until I receive proper validation and your offices provide Claimant with proof of claim of the disputed debt. Your offices have 30 days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant credit reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated.

Again, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is the crooked company who stole my family 's home at the auction, and is paying BIG money to Attorney XXXX XXXX # XXXX to continuously harass my family and me by sending us threatening letters, and phone calls attempting to steal our home and throw us out into the street. Of course this was at the direction of Wells Fargo. Had my magnificent Mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the account holder had been alive, she would have been XXXX years old on XX/XX/XXXX of this year. Wells Fargo, was continuously harassing my Mother when she was alive, threatening her with notices, which increased her stress level, causing her to become ill and unfortunately passed away a few years ago. My Mother had a lawsuit in place against Wells Fargo for unfairly taking advantage of her as a senior, and practicing predatory lending practices against her. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo was trying to throw my XXXX year old Mother into the street. Go figure ... Presently, Wells Fargo has teamed up with several of their cohorts to attempt to destroy our families dream. Quite naturally, this TRILLION dollar company is steadily denying any wrongdoing whatsoever. This is how Wells Fargo has managed to become a trillion dollar predatory lender due to the fact that this horrific company has attempted to steal the dreams of middle class families illegally, committing fraud for many years forcing middle class families out of the homes, which is why the former CEO of Wells Fargo, whose name is XXXX XXXX XXXX has be forced to step down by Congresswoman XXXX XXXX. It appears, however, that the general counsel who has interimly taken over as CEO, XXXX XXXX XXXX, appears to be just as crooked as XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo needs to be shut down, and many other class action lawsuits should be filed repeatedly, and dismantle this TRILLION dollar corrupt lender, until they file bankruptcy, which I am positive will be transpiring very soon.

It continually shows the wrong amount due and incorrect due dates. Example : Login to the webpage it shows amount due as {$310.00} then look at the electronic statement and it shows {$290.00}. Consumers would be unsure as to what amount is actually due. Now at the end of the lease it shows {$750.00} due and no statement for XX/XX/XXXX. I called and they said I only owe {$140.00} ( which I paid ). I do not trust this company at all and I'm sure there will be more charges even though they tell me this XXXX 's out my account. This is very confusing and I have been very diligent to pay attention to statement amounts instead of the website but I'm worried that others would incur late payments and other financial hardships based on misinformation. This is very bad business. When I asked about this several times the only answer I got was they are working on it or they don't know why it shows this. I have talked to other GM financial customers who have similar stories. This needs to be investigated for predatory lending practices.

2018-12-21,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with customer service,"This complaint is in conjunction with complaint XXXX. Initially I was unable to use my card for several months upon credit approval. Several attempts to contact hsbc and several hours of being put on hold and hung up on lead to my initial complaint.

Now, I have completed the online banking months ago as well to manage my account. HSBCs initial classificationof my account has caused me not to have the ability to log on, I have also stopped receiving paper letters in the mail showing me my statement. Since opening I have made one payment over the phone for the complete balance. However now I do not know the remaining payments or due dates which is preventing me to make my payment and ensure I have a XXXX  balance. 

I hurt my credit by opening this account with the intention of using rewards points, benefiting from the annual match of points, using my rewards points, and benefiting from the 0 % transfer. 

I was forced to open an additional card to perform the balance transfer, further harming my credit score. I am unable to use my rewards points because I can not log online. I have been prevented from using my card for several months limiting the benefit I would receive in rewards points and more importantly the annual match. I can not make a payment on this account due to unknown balances which I have never had a late payment and am afraid this may occur due to the mismanagement of opening this account. 

In addition to the hours spent already in the aforementioned complaint I spent additional hours trying to fix my online banking issues. I have attempted several days to contact customer service and resolve this issue. They continue to transfer me from to different departments until I drop from the conversation. Attached are additional documents of me attempting to open my online activity. 

In the aforementioned complaint HSBCs response rewarded me with {$100.00} in rewards points. This is an inadequate amount based on the harm this experience has caused to me credit score and the inability to use the benefits of the card which is why I opened it. Additionally, I can not use any of the rewards I was provided because I can not log on to my accounts although several customer service agents confirmed I opened my online accounts correctly.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,CO,806XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3106996

XX/XX/XXXX - another call to Rushmore asking for assistance of tracking my payment and resolving the credit reporting. Still no assistance in helping. Therefore, I went to my bank and REWIRED ANOTHER PAYMENT.

They offer no customer service to assist in rectifying the situation other than the customer doing all the calling ; following up.

As of today XX/XX/XXXX, Rushmore has now an additional {$73.00} due to the double payment in which they can not tell me how or when the payment will be reissued back to me. Again, no one to speak with at all to assist in resolving issue. 

I have made every attempt possible to rectify the situation with no assistance whatsoever from Rushmore other than being treated like an individual who is trying NOT to pay a {$0.00} debt when I clearly paid a {$15000.00} debt I owed timely.

In XX/XX/2018, when I filed the prior complaint, I had {$15.00} in the savings account. However, due to BofAs improper failure to close my savings account and in the meantime charge me $ 5 monthly fees, the current balance is now - {$10.00}. This is entirely due to BofAs fees. 

I was very clear in my last complaint that given BofAs unfair, opaque, and predatory consumer banking policies, I no longer want to be a BofA customer. Why did they close my checking account but not my savings account? This appears to be an attempt to continue to generate fees from me when my savings account should have been closed long ago, and is once again evidence of BofAs pernicious and opaque practices that act to the detriment of the everyday consumer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",DC,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-19,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3247042

They returned results that stated "" all information correct and verified with reporting company ''. I then did a little research on how to have errors removed from your credit report, as well as spoke to an attorney that advised me to send certified letters to both companies asking that the accounts be verified with proof of that verification. One company ( A collection Agency ) refused the letter, the other sent me a response that said they had verified the information with the credit bureaus and was not required to provide any proof to me other than they verified my identity on this credit card ON-LINE. So apparently crooks don't open accounts on-line???!!! 
So I filed WRITTEN disputes to all three Credit Bureaus, sent them all Certified Mail, and just received a response from XXXX stating once again regarding the same account - "" Information verified with reporting agency '' and nothing more. That's it??? Of course the reporting agency is going to "" confirm '' that their information is correct, but don't they need to provide some sort of PROOF other than their word?!!!!! What more can I do as a consumer to have this addressed/investigated properly??? 
The other account that I am disputing flat out refused to accept the letter that I sent them certified. Now what? I've filed written dispute as well on this response, but have not gotten a response yet from any of the Credit Bureaus.

I immediately received a alert limit email notification which I set to be {$75.00}. I reported it to Chase immediately. They issued me the money immediately and told me they would investigate. A couple weeks later I notice that Chase took the money back out from my account. I called and they said they denied my fraud claim and stated I need to provide more evidence. I contacted my local sheriffs department and filed a police report so they can get ahold of video surveillance to prove it wasnt me. The police officer told me to contact Chase and to submit the case number and that they know what to do since they always deal with this stuff. I contact Chase again and now they are telling me to have the Sheriffs department fax the police report to them. I contact the sheriffs department and they stated they usually dont do that type of stuff. Chase is making extremely difficult for me to get my money back and for them to accept fraud claim. I thought I had fraud protection, but its not working for me. I dont feel safe with Chase having all money ( they are my primary checking account and its where all my direct deposits go to ). Luckily it was only {$100.00} but its not the amount of money that matters, its the principal. It will be weeks until I get my money back. Extremely unhappy with how Chase has handled this and how they are making so difficult for me to get my money back.

2019-03-01,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"In 2016, I was charged over {$1700.00} in overdraft charges after chase bank removed my access to mobile bank deposits. I have recorded conversations with bank employees, recorded with their consent, explicitly stating that the feature was removed due to low funding levels in my account, though no official guidelines were ever presented to me, despite multiple requests. My complaint is split into two parts : 1. ) Chase Bank utilized predatory tactics to remove mobile deposit from consumers who would most benefit from the feature. I was forced to incur heavy overdraft fees, many of which were returned when bank employees agreed that fees were caused exclusively due to the removal of that feature. After multiple instances when the bank agreed with my complaints and reversed fees, they continued agreeing but no longer had the capacity to reverse the charges. In one instance, when the city of XXXX was completely flooded and no street access existed to banks or atms, I was still charged a fee, even when I showed the ability to make a deposit as soon as the streets became accessible. Instances such as this occurred on numerous occasions, and each time employees told me that my feature had been removed due to a history of overdrafts, which was entirely created as a result of the removal, itself. This policy of removing the feature for customers with low or negative balances puts us into a purposeful loop of overdraft fees, which bank employees acknowledged as a known problem. 

2. ) I asked on numerous occasions to be given written or formal guidelines about my rights, as a consumer to utilize the mobile deposit feature. While in my recordings bank employees give vastly different answers about the terms of use, none could provide me with clear written rules. Who qualifies for that feature? When will mine be turned on? Why was the feature removed as a result of overdraft fees? All indicated that the feature was removed due to low funds or overdrafts, but none could explain why removal came as a consequence of those facts. Several employees agreed that this was an unfair practice and indicated that numerous customers called in with similar complaints over time. The second portion of my complaint is thus about the bank 's lack of transparency about customer terms of use. 

My recorded conversations with employees are from XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/2016, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, XX/XX/16, and XX/XX/16. In total, throughout that period I was assessed {$1700.00} in fees, though {$500.00} were refunded by employees who agreed that I had done all I could to avoid them.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,770XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3166742

I accrued over a XXXX dollars in overdraft and NSF fees and have records to prove this. I called PNC multiple times and asked of anything could be done to stop this with zero help. I was transferred to a supervisor department after the 1st employees claimed they could not reverse any of the fees as the system would not let them. The phone rang once and I got an automated message that said no one was available and the call automatically ended. Never called back. Accepting that they would not budge to work with me or help me at all, I paid the fees and brought my account back to positive and moved on.

So, my paycheck finally hit the account for XXXX dollars on Friday XX/XX/19. Then at XXXX on Saturday XX/XX/19 I was charged 3 more XXXX dollar overdraft fees after my paycheck had already hit the account. Because my paycheck has gone through I did not expect this. I have so many bills coming out this week from having to wait 2 weeks to get paid, that I can not afford XXXX dollars in overdraft fees. This is my whole grocery budget for the next 2 weeks until I get paid again and I literally have no food in my apartment. I called again today XX/XX/19 asking for assistance in this especially because my paycheck had hit and there is no reason for the fees to be met with no help again and told I should use tips to avoid overdrafting. Enough is enough of this. Ive paid so much in overdraft fees that I can't afford to live. All I want was the 3 most recent overdraft fees refunded to me so I can afford groceries so I don't starve without over drafting again and having the same thing happen while I wait another 2 weeks to get paid. I have exhausted all options to avoid this. I have overdraft protection on my account. I have alerts sent to me when my account drops below XXXX dollars. The way PNC does their business makes it impossible to avoid this because it happens over night while you are sleeping and then to offer no solution to a good, 6 year customer is frustrating and disheartening.",,PNC Bank N.A.,WI,531XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-12,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3123079

I made a purchase in XX/XX/XXXX for a dresser that was {$790.00} plus tax and delivery. Delivery day came not merchandise..I called to be informed that I never confirmed the delivery date ( which I did upon leaving the store via the link sent in a text ) so I was going out of town and chose to not wait on another date and cancelled the order. Was told by the store I cant cancel with them I needed to contact comenity bank Which I did. They said since the delivery wasnt confirmed, nothing was taken from my card so there was nothing to refund. I confirmed that I still had my available balance and hung up.

Went to check out, it said unable to process. I logged in to my account to find I had {$97.00} avail credit. What!!!!!

I have NEVER made payments late in over 10 years with any mortgage payment and usually make the 2nd payment in a month ( prior month to due date ) at least 1 to 3 days early. My wife and I earn over {$180000.00} per year and do not have any issues making any debt payment!

At the time the transfer became effective, I had already paid XXXX XXXX  for the month of XXXX as I always due before the end of the previous month. M & T Bank sent me a bill not giving me credit for XX/XX/2019 payments that had already been made to XXXX XXXX prior to the transfer. Secondly, since I thought this was an error, I waited for a corrected statement. Instead, I received a pass due notice when my XXXX payment was not even due! 

I called M & T Bank on last Friday, XX/XX/2019 and explained everything above to the representative. Instead of assisting me with the issue, she kept giving me the run around and telling me that I had "" to change the way I was paying by logging on and signing up for their every-two-week payment bank draft ''. This was a direct contradiction to what I had been guaranteed in writing that I would NOT have to change the way I had been paying my mortgage properly for years. Secondly, she did nothing to bring my mortgage account current as it should be. 

Lastly, I just received by mail another pass due notice stating that I owe {$2900.00}, when in fact, I OWE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! The M & T Bank bill also included some {$920.00} "" Hazard Disbursement '' amount, which has never appeared on any previous mortgage bill, and they never explained it to me. 

My payments are current, and documentation is attached to prove it! If I were not late with XXXX XXXX, how could I now be late with M & T Bank when I have continued to make all payments twice a month or even every two weeks right through their transfer of mortgage process, for which again, I did not ask nor desire? 

This is absolutely ridiculous, and I expect the federal government to take the strongest possible action against this bank. They did not even listen to me or even try to correct the situation. I have been a perfect customer, I always pay all bills on time ( my credit score proves that ), and I will not tolerate this harassment in the lease.

2018-06-03,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","On XX/XX/XXXX, I formally requested removal of PMI for my mortgage stating that Ive reached 80.0 % LTV. My mortgage is held by Sierra Pacific Mortgage and serviced by XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Sierra Pacific Mortgage stating some conditions for PMI removal. Among those conditions were that a ) for primary residences loans, less than 5 years old require LTV of 75 % and b ) for multi-family residences the required LTV is 70 %.  They also stated I would have to pay for an appraisal. 

My mortgage disclosures from Sierra Pacific at the time of my mortgage closing very specifically state that my required LTV is 80 %, at which time I can request PMI be removed. The Sierra Pacific Mortgage website for my loan also states this 80 % LTV. 

At no point prior to receiving their letter was any 70 % or 75 % LTV requirement mentioned. 

I called Sierra Pacific repeatedly to address this issue. I talked the front line support about this and they would not put me in touch with the PMI department. They told me my PMI cancellation request was denied and that I needed a mortgage balance of {$440000.00} ( 70 % ) LTV to remove PMI ( my property is a two flat ). 

At this point I escalated the issue to a supervisor ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I was transferred to XXXX XXXX. He told me that he would reach out to the PMI department and get me more information in 3-5 days. I called XXXX XXXX on his direct line ( XXXX ) and left him message on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. He did not answer or return any of my calls. 

At this point Ive hit a dead end. I cant get in touch with any one helpful to remove my PMI and Im continuing to pay it despite hitting my requisite loan to value.",,SIERRA PACIFIC MORTGAGE,IL,600XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-06-03,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2925151

I contacted the Capital One call center on XX/XX/2019 - the offshore representative said she would not obtain any details since it was with the Fraud Department but I was going to need to provide 3 documents for them to review. I was not willing to provide documents without more insight into what was happening or the issue being investigated. I asked to be transferred if a Supervisor but after waiting on hold for over 8 minutes -- I disconnected the call. 

I contacted the Capital One call center on XX/XX/2019 - I was routed through the auto-dialer to the Fraud Department. The representative was polite but unable to give me any detailed information about the status of my accounts. He explained I would need to provide a picture of my Oregon Driver 's License via a secure email link. Upon review, I would receive a phone call advising on the status of my accounts. I received the email, took 4 pictures of my ODL, and attached to the secured link and received a confirmation message indicating the transmission was successful. 

I contacted the Capital One call center on XX/XX/2019 - I was routed through the auto-dialer to the Fraud Department ( XXXX  ). I voiced my frustration about not receiving any status on the review nor a call as indicated by the XX/XX/2019 rep. XXXX advised no documents were received and provided a little more detail into possibilities of someone else attempting to retrieve or access my account. He did not or could not provide specifics. He sent me a new link to provide my documents and waiting on the call with me to confirm receipt. He was not able to confirm receipt since the documents again were not received. He was going to consult another party to confirm if there was a technical issue to explain why my documents were not being received. Then, the call disconnected. 

I can not begin to express to you how perplexing, concerning, and frustrating this has become to me as a long-standing Capital One customer. I may not have thousands of dollars of CC activity each year but I am definitely a customer who pays their bills and is paying monthly interest on my credit cards. I NEED someone to explain to me the specifics of the current restricted status of my accounts. I NEED someone to confirm receipt of my previous 2 submissions. I do not think it is too much to ask especially since it is MY personal information Capital One is requesting and asking me to compile without giving me any details. It is an odd way to do business and definitely lacks transparency. 

I noticed the restricted message on my Capital One mobile app when I was checking the status of my autopay. There has been no verbal or written outreach by Capital One to me to advise or inform about the status of my account either.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,OR,973XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3137137

During the chat he had opened an investigation to stop these payments ( as I was under the impression ) I had never heard anything back about the investigation on those specific fee 's. The fee 's were charged by companies I had changed my bank account info over to my new bank account. During the call with the executive resolution department on the XXXX He credited back those fee 's and moved the money back over to my account. He also gave me a {$100.00} credit for a pending debit transaction which was later removed again out of my account for some reason. Another one of my accounts that should have been closed over a year ago was still open so he closed that account. I was also under the impression my other account that was getting charged these NSF fee 's would be closed as well and the fee 's would be credited back to me. He could only credit the ones that had been charged to me as of that day which he did. 
Today XX/XX/XXXX, I'm looking at that account and I see it's still open and has been charged numerous NSF fee 's.

This account should have been closed and any additional fee 's should be credited. 
Today XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke to someone else in the resolution team who told me I am at my limit and they do not see this account should have been closed when in fact I was under the impression it would be and no more fee 's should be charged.

NOTICE TO FURNISHERS OF INFORMATION : OBLIGATIONS OF FURNISHERS UNDER THE FCRA The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. Sections 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. section 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. The text of the FCRA is available at the website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. A list of the sections of the FCRA cross-referenced to the U.S. Code is at the end of this document.

Section 623 imposes the following duties upon furnishers : Accuracy Guidelines The FCRA requires furnishers to comply with federal guidelines and regulations dealing with the accuracy of information provided to CRAs by furnishers. Federal regulations and guidelines are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623 ( e ).

General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ).

Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute From Consumer If a consumer notifies a furnisher, at an address specified by the furnisher for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

Furnishers must comply with federal regulations that identify when an information furnisher must investigate a dispute made directly to the furnisher by a consumer. Under these regulations, furnishers must complete an investigation within 30 days ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information ) unless the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant or comes from a "" credit repair organization. '' Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ). Federal regulations are available at www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore. Section 623 ( a ) ( 8 ).

Duties After Notice of Dispute From Consumer Reporting Agency If a CRA notifies a furnisher that a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information provided by thefurnisher, the furnisher has a duty to follow certain procedures. The furnisher must : Conduct an investigation and review all relevant information provided by the CRA, including information given to the CRA by the consumer. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

Report the results to the CRA that referred the dispute, and, if the investigation establishes that the information was, in fact, incomplete or inaccurate, report the results to all CRAs to which the furnisher provided the information that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis. Sections 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( C ) and ( b ) ( 1 ) ( D ).

Complete the above steps within 30 days from the date the CRA receives the dispute ( or 45 days, if the consumer later provides relevant additional information to the CRA ). Section 623 ( b ) ( 2 ).

Promptly modify or delete the information, or block its reporting. Section 623 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( E ).

Duty to Report Voluntary Closing of Credit Accounts If a consumer voluntarily closes a credit account, any person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnished information to one or more CRAs must report this fact when it provides information to CRAs for the time period in which the account was closed. Section 623 ( a ) ( 4 ).

Duty to Report Dates of Delinquencies If a furnisher reports information concerning a delinquent account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subject to any similar action, the furnisher must, within 90 days after reporting the information, provide the CRA with the month and the year of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action, so that the agency will know how long to keep the information in the consumer 's file. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Any person, such as a debt collector, that has acquired or is responsible for collecting delinquent accounts and that reports information to CRAs may comply with the requirements of Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( until there is a consumer dispute ) by reporting the same delinquency date previously reported by the creditor. If the creditor did not report this date, they may comply with the FCRA by establishing reasonable procedures to obtain and report delinquency dates, or, if a delinquency date can not be reasonably obtained, by following reasonable procedures to ensure that the date reported precedes the date when the account was placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected to any similar action. Section 623 ( a ) ( 5 ).

Duties of Financial Institutions When Reporting Negative Information Financial institutions that furnish information to "" nationwide '' consumer reporting agencies, as defined in Section 603 ( p ), must notify consumers in writing if they may furnish or have furnished negative information to a CRA. Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ). The CFPB has prescribed model disclosures, 12 CFR Part 1022, App. B.

Duties When Furnishing Medical Information A furnisher whose primary business is providing medical services, products, or devices ( and such furnisher 's agents or assignees ) is a medical information furnisher for the purposes of the FCRA and must notify all CRAs to which it reports of this fact. Section 623 ( a ) ( 9 ). This notice will enable CRAs to comply with their duties under Section 604 ( g ) when reporting medical information.

Duties When ID Theft Occurs All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each CRA of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher may not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances. Section 615 ( f ).

XXXX, the loan servicer for the U.S. Department of Education stated by letter that the loan would be reported to credit reporting agencies as discharged. TransUnion continues to report the loan as an unresolved dispute, not specified. Furthermore, since the loan was connected to a proven fraudulent student loan history that is massive known fraudulent signatories and a wrong university I never attended, I requested that the loan be removed from all credit reports and not re-posted. Additionally, TransUnion re-posted a phone number that was disconnected more than 3 years ago after removing it and informing me by letter that no phone numbers would be put on my credit report. I asked all credit reporting agencies to not post any phone numbers to my credit reports since I change the number frequently, sometimes 4 times in a month. All credit reporting agencies have compiled with the request to remove outdated, inaccurate information, and also, removed the student loan that is no longer subject to monitoring and thus no longer subject to being reported - every credit reporting agency except for TransUnion.

I had a personal loan with Avant  or XXXX XXXX and when it had fallen behind I was under the impression I was with an in house Collection or team who would help me get the account in current status and not until I missed a payment is when all of a suddent this collection is on my credit and they demand the full payment or an unaffordable monthly payment. The whole relationship with this collection agency has been falsely represented and unfair from the start and they need to be fined or looked into on their practices. Furthermore, if this is a business who wants to settle or collect on a debt they would have realistic payments and at this point I am being yo-yoed and played with over a debt that could be paid for and settled.

2019-01-09,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","I dont know where to start with this company. Everything started when I filed for homestead on my home. My realtor and mortgage broker advised me it would decrease my payments. I did everything I was told to do, by county and mortgage company in XXXX of 2018. I called Primary Resediential Mortgage 2 times that month for directions for filing homestead and then to confirm EVERYTHING was received. I got a confirmation that everything was in and great. Fast forward to XXXX when I get a letter in the mail that an escrow analysis was ran and caused my mortgage to increase because my property taxes increased to over {$2000.00}. I was beside myself, called PRMI and they said that I didnt send in the right info for my homestead and they found my property taxes raised to {$2000.00}. I submitted to PRMI my tax form I received in the mail showing y taxes were only going to be the high of {$1300.00}. I sent the them the confirmation and they re- ran the analysis and called me back and said good news, its going down. PRMI sent me a check said were all good, we wont run your analysis again for another year. So naturally, I cash this check and move on with life. 

Let me add in, in the middle of all this I had to speak with a manager because every rep I worked with couldnt do anything but read a script and understand the problem with my analysis. I spoke with XXXX XXXX which I will provide the emails sent to me from him. The first time I spoke with Jaes he advised would have to call me back the next day. I accepted. Well I guess that was the wrong thing to do, after not hearing from him I called back. The rep I spoke with said he wasnt in the office and he told her to just send me an email. Thats highly unacceptable, I demanded to speak with him. They finally transferred me over to him and he had the nerve to tell me that he was leaving out of town that next day and just didnt have time to talk to me. What a manager, I would review his status with the company. Well finally he sent me an email confirming everything was great the next day and what my new mortgage payment would be. Also, in this email he highlighted how his company provided me all incorrect information about my homestead and escrow payments and apologized for their mistake. 

To add to this problem I had in XXXX, I asked the 3 times about my homeowners insurance because I kept getting cancellation notices in the mail. Every single time they would say well look into it. I live in Florida, in the middle of hurricane season and they cant even get making a payment right? 

Well after I FINALLY had all of this settled I thought I could continue through the year without having to call this company. Well, I was wrong again. Fast forward now to XXXX, I receive a letter in the mail again from Primary Residential mortgage Inc and they said that my escrow analysis was going to be ran AGAIN and my mortgage will increase AGAIN! I got on the phone right away again and spoke with a rep who assured me that thats an automated message they have to send out and assured me that no, they only run it one a year and thats for next year. Silly me, I believe her and went about my life. Fast forward now to XXXX and I receive an actual new escrow analysis AGAIN raising my mortgage. I get back on the phone again and immediately ask for a manager. Well I get XXXX again. XXXX says he has to review my account and XXXX call back again in 2 business days. Why should it take that long, research now I asked. He said well today is over and I just dont have the time. When Im at work my day isnt over until I clock out and being as you guys were still in business hours I should have been taken care of. I accepted and advised okay call me tomorrow. 

The day came, XXXX called back. I spoke with XXXX and all he had to say was because I closed on my house on XXXX ( which I didnt, closed in XXXX ) they always run an escrow 12 months after closing. He then started to say that Primary residential hasnt done anything wrong and I just have to live with it. 

Well this is where I have stopped with this company. At this time, I just want to sell my house, refinance, anything to get away from this horrible company. It has been 12 months and I have had to call this comp at every single month since XXXX! A mortgage company shouldnt be able to raise and lower my mortgage at their pleasure every single month. Also, I shouldnt have to worry whether my insurance will be paid for my home. Please, please someone help with his company.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE,FL,335XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3120035

2019-02-24,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To whom it may concern, I am writing this complaint and addressing "" Experian, XXXX  and XXXX  who are three of the elite credit bureau agencies who ultimately has a stronghold over your life by reporting credit information. To begin I am very VERY disappointed and dissatisfied with the way that Experian, XXXX and XXXX runs and conducts business. They are supposed to by LAW report ACCURATE and updated information regarding individuals credit files as well as conduct ACTUAL investigations so they will only be reporting fair and ACCURATE information according to the FCRA. 

However stating these facts it has come to my knowledge that these Credit Agencies are NOT conducting business as they should by law. I have been disputing the item listed below for approximately 5 months now with no correct resolution which is removal from my credit report. Please note that Experian, XXXX, XXXX nor any one speaking for or on the behalf of each company can say otherwise due to the fact that I do send and retain all of my dispute letters and responses on top of me ALWAYS sending my dispute letters via Certified Mail. The item listed below is and has been due for removal for a numerous amount of reasons. Please also note that all three Credit Bureaus always CLAIM that they have done an investigation which I know is not true and the reasons are listed below for the creditor. 

CREDITOR : 1. "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' : To begin, This item should have been removed from my Credit files due to it being PAST the Nevada statute of Limitations, and not to forget to mention that with this creditor I have absolutely no ties with or contract with. Also I have the paperwork that this creditor sent me which is absolutely FALSE AND COUNTERFEIT ( also sent to Experian, XXXX and XXXX in a prior dispute )! There are incorrect dates that do not correlate with the actual information and reporting, The "" Date of Contract '' clashes and voids the actual initial paperwork given ( which is counterfeit, against the law and considered erroneous information which each company should have noticed upon their "" dispute investigation '' ). If you look at the "" contract '' that this company sent to me you will notice that on page 1 of 6 ( which they did not send me all 6 pages of ) for the "" Date of Lease Contract '' ( when the Lease Contract is filled out ) it states the Date of XX/XX/XXXX which is not possible due to the fact on Page 6 of 6 ( what seems to be the contract signing page ) states that it was signed on XX/XX/XXXX. If you look closely to the left side of this sign date is physically states "" Date form is filled out ( same as top of page 1 ) '' Which it does not. That leads and proves that this document is counterfeit erroneous information as well as making the contract VOID! Also I would like to point out even more erroneous and information referring back to page 1 of 1 of the document sent to me from the creditor. If you refer to section 6 of the document you will see that it states the "" Rent and Charges '' are a total of {$790.00} for the total lease period. Now if you will refer to the document with the Header "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) '' noted below to the right it gives a list of all dates and amounts ( which again clashes, voids and proves that XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as the credit bureaus are reporting false information. ). This brings me to point out the incorrect information on this document in regards to my credit file. My move in date on this document states I moved in XX/XX/XXXX and my "" Lease End Date '' was XX/XX/XXXX with my rent being {$970.00}. Also please be aware that if and as shown that my Lease date ended on XX/XX/XXXX how is it possible that this creditor is showing on my credit report with an opened date of XX/XX/XXXX on Experian and XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX when I had already moved out? The answer is it's not. Everything about this item on my credit is totally bogus, out of the Statute of limitations, erroneous and counterfeit information and needs to be removed. Nothing matches and some how it is still being reported on my Credit reports which is absolutely unacceptable.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,NV,890XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3161288

Experian, XXXX XXXX and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from Experian and XXXX was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote Experian and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only Experian wrote back a letter dated XXXX stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

XXXX XXXX never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with XXXX, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because Experian, XXXX  and XXXX XXXX all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.

I have a child with XXXX XXXX, and it takes specialized experience in dealing with such children to be able to Consult and treat them 2. When I took my daughter ( my son 's sister ) for her annual exam, I inquired at the office, and they informed me that their doctors have experience and will be able to examine my son 3. When I visited them with my son, the doctor was unable to do any exam on my  son and finally gave up saying he needs to be examined under XXXX. 
4. They handed me a 'treatment plan ' that required me to pay thousands of dollars. 
5. Subsequently, they sent me a bill saying that since they were not able to do a comprehensive exam ( which is covered by insurance ), they called it a limited exam. My point was that the doctor never really examined the child at all - and the doctor clearly had no experience dealing with Children with XXXX XXXX. Something the office made me believe to set me up for the appointment.

They used a third party XXXX XXXX to verify a Bankruptcy who is not the originator of the debt. 

More so Experian unfortunately told a complete lie on their verification methods. I suppressed the XXXX XXXX file on XX/XX/XXXX also requested my report.

I called the Bank which was Chase and ask about it, the agent told me that all my credit cards from Chase were closed and that no information can be disclosed until I will receive a letter about it. 
I had 5 chase credit card, the Chase Business Ink, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, the Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Chase Hyatt Credit card, and the Chase Ihg credit card. In addition, my wife that was an authorized user on one of my cards, got her only card closed ( the Chase Sapphire Preferred card ). 
Chase claim was that I was requesting too many credit cards in a short time and that was a payment made from another company once. 
Although I had these 5 cards with Chase, they were open over a long period of time ( 4 years ) and they had different purposes. I always paid my bills on time and never had high spending on those cards. My incomes were high enough to justify all the credit limit I had. 
I did pay off once my balance with a check from a company, this was because I had a contract with them and some of my expenses that occurred during my work with them were paid with my personal credit card. It was normal to reimburse these expenses directly from the company 's check. 
I called Chase many time and spoke with many representatives but no one was able to help me with this.

They told it me it was because funds in my account went down, however, if they were monitoring my account, the could have been avoided prior to accepting a contract that I had submitted. Not only did they review and accept the contract, they had me, complete an inspection, secure an attorney, and purchase a condo questionnaire. My realtor sent emails to ensure that we were on track and we never got a no. There have been so many complaints online regarding naca but I still tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. There lack of responsiveness and perceived lack of care frustrated both my realtor and attorney. There has been constant mixed messages and doesnt seem like this program has any empathy for their clients. They seem to be preying on neighborhood clients versus helping them. Even after denying me, they still proceeded to take out fraudulent membership dues and money for a credit report. If you deny me of a loan I get approved for by the alternate lenders in 5 min. I sent a complaint to XXXX  and NACA for a refund of the fees over the last year and they denied me again. They dont think there is anything wrong with there process and the offered no help at all instead went back and forth with me in an email war to try and prove he was right without even picking up the phone to talk to me. This is the second time that naca nearly caused me to lose a home. The first offer I submitted, was denied by the seller because they didnt want to work with naca due to a reputation of the process taking too long. They asked me to switch  lenders and they would consider. Believing in naca, I stayed the course until I realized they werent really trying to help me. They never even offered an alternate solution. This process has been so long and complicated and all I want is for my money tp be refunded so that I can finally be done with naca for good.

There were accounts open in my name. I notified the company in writing by sending them notarized identity theft forms and statements, and a multitude of correspondence, yet the fraudulent accounts still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. They stated in both the first investigation as well as the re-investigation that they verified that those accounts and that they were being reported correctly, which was COMPLETELY UNTRUE!! I then, demanded that this company not only tell me who verified these accounts as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), I demanded to know the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). I also requested that this company send me a copy of the original creditors documentation, or ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as they are required under FCRA to keep a copy in their files to verify that this information is mine and correct. THEY DID NOT DO ANY OF THE ABOVE. Under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA they are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. Pursuant to section 605B they are required to BLOCK the fraudulent information on my credit report resulting from identity theft within 4 business days and notify the furnisher of that information, in which they HAVE NOT DONE! THE LAW IS VERY CLEAR AND THEY FAIL TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW.

2019-03-13,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,"","SPS 2nd : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Before we begin it is important to note that SPS services both the 1st and 2nd loans on this property, and that they belong to different investors, with differing guidelines, that are in conflict with one another. This creates many problems when it comes to short sales, or any other type of negotiation, as they can not best protect either investor in a situation where the demands from each investor require the other to lower their net proceeds. SPS does not allow a prospective buyer to bring in additional monies to satisfy a demand from a junior lien holder, and in the State of California, a seller is never allowed to contribute any monies to satisfy demands. So that means the offer on the table is the only amount of money we have to work with to satisfy all liens on a property. 

The time line below shows the level of gross incompetence and possible purposeful negligence of the underwriting department in the review for loss mitigation on BOTH loans for this property. I have highlighted with *** the particularly problematic issues and communications. They have 2 sets of rules that are in direct conflict with one another. They should have known that there was no way for them to work out this loss mitigation file. 

XX/XX/XXXX Submitted to SPS offer was {$430000.00} XX/XX/XXXX Got value back of XXXX. We were asked to increase the net but not told what they required. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called the SPS Ombudsman to see if they could find out what the minimum required net is, and they were unable to tell me. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We sent market comps and an inspection report to support our offer of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Rep at ombudsmans office said we were about 6k off minimum net required. We revised the HUD to reflect an increase to the net proceeds to the 1st trust deed by XXXX and sent that back to SPS XX/XX/XXXX Per Ombudsman, no response to our higher net. 

XX/XX/XXXX Called ombudsman, no response. Ombudsman sent message to underwriting to please get response XXXX Per the Ombudsman, underwriting somehow managed to close the review on XXXX yet the ombudsman never got notice of that, and wasn't apparent in the database. Instead, underwriting approved the XXXX 's for a repayment plan. The ombudsman can do NOTHING until one of the XXXX 's call in to decline that repayment on a recorded line. they can call the ombudsman to do so, to make sure it gets done right. we need to send all short and offer docs again to both XXXX and XXXX along with a letter requesting rush review due to us thinking we were in review for an entire month and no one ever told us we weren't. 

XX/XX/XXXX Resubmitted entire file and the homeowner called the ombudsman to decline payment plan that was never requested. 

XX/XX/XXXX Per XXXX in the Ombudsman department, the underwriter on the 1st denied the offer again wanting a further increased net. Yet again, they refused to provide us what net they wanted, making this a very frustrating guessing game for the buyers and the sellers. 

XX/XX/XXXX We increased the net again, and resubmitted the new offer. 

XX/XX/XXXX Underwriting for the 2nd demanded a corrected RMA and we sent that back on the same day XX/XX/XXXX Ombudsman told us that both loans were active in short sale review. 

XX/XX/XXXX We were told it looked like the 1st and 2nd were negotiating between each other and to expect decision by XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX Finally got word that the investor for the 1st Trust Deed approved the short sale and that now the file can go to the investor to the 2nd for approval. As is normal for ALL short sales we do with SPS, the net to the 2nd was {$8500.00}. It is important to note here, that SPS never allows more than XXXX to go to a junior lien on any short sale, except in some GSE situations where the guidelines state the maximum is XXXX. We were told by SPS that they had internally approved the 2nd and just needed investor signoff. 
XXXX We were now told that the 2nd is requiring no less than 25,000 to approve the short sale, on a loan of XXXX. This is where the conflict of interest comes into play when the same company is servicing the 1st and 2nd for different investors. In NO short sale would SPS ever allow 30 % of the UPB to go to a 2nd when the 1st is still short. We were asked to revise the HUD showing XXXX to the 2nd. At that point I informed the Ombudsman that I believe we would then have a problem with the 1st, as we had already been fighting over meeting their net proceeds and per their investors policy of not allowing any 3rd party including the buyer or agents to contribute to satisfy junior liens, and the State of Californias law that sellers may not contribute in a short sale, this would then result in a substantial decrease to the net on the 1st. Ombudsman still asked us to send the HUD showing increased net to the 2nd, and decreased net to the 1st. We sent it same day. 

XXXX Ombudsman confirmed receipt of new HUD and attached it to both accounts. 

XXXX Ombudsman escalated issue again for resolution on the issues with both the 1st and 2nd nets. 
**** At this point I started calling twice a day for updates**** XX/XX/XXXX Still nothing back explained to ombudsman that based on the 1st TD approval letter and the verbal that the 2nd had been internally approved, that the buyer started working on their loan. Now their rate lock is expiring and asked them to please escalate again. Was told that they would attempt to escalate this to the highest level of management to get it going. Was also reassured that the issues for the 1st and the 2nd were escalated and tied together. 

XXXX Was told investor for 2nd has approved the file, but it needed to go through QC and there was nothing they could do regarding the net issues for the 1st until the letter for the 2nd had been issued even though we had been told repeatedly that they were escalated TOGETHER. 

XX/XX/XXXX Was told that the ombudsman had this escalated to the highest level and they send a message to find out what was taking so long. 

XX/XX/XXXX. Was told by ombudsman department that it had notes in the system for the 2nd from the 8th that it was being worked on by XXXX. 

XXXX Was told by ombudsman that this had only been sent to QC on the XXXX. We asked how that could possibly be the case and referenced our previous notes, we were then told it had failed QC on the XXXX but there were no notes as to why and that it was sent back to QC on the XXXX and escalated again. 

XXXX. Was told that the 2nd TD NEVER SENT THE FILE TO THE INVESTOR. They had NO EXPLANATION about all the times I was told it was approved and the approval letter was in the QC department. At this point it is obvious that we have been lied to throughout the entire process with SPSs 2nd TD department. ************Keep in mind we started this short sale with SPS on XX/XX/XXXX, so we have been LIED TO FOR OVER FOUR MONTHS. They have harmed not only their own investor ( s ) and their borrower, but also the buyer as they are preventing them from finding another property in this difficult market. 

I want SPS fined to the maximum amount allowed by law, I want the conflict of interest investigated and I want the short sale approved AS IT STANDS for both the 1st and the 2nd liens and I want SPS to be required to make up the difference for their investors.

2018-01-21,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"A recent inquiry into my credit report with all 3 bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX ) made me aware of 2 accounts that report negatively on my credit bureau files. Research revealed that these 2 entities are owned by the parent company known as XXXX XXXX , XXXX . These 2 entities are XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX  XXXX. These debts are not mine, yet they appear on my credit bureau file ( s ) as charged off debts. 

The XXXX XXXX account appears with a balance due of {$150.00}. I have never had an account with this organization. The XXXX XXXX XXXX account appears on my credit bureau file ( s ) as an Unsecured loan account with a charged off balance of {$410.00}. I have never obtained a loan from this organization and based on the corporate description, was unaware that they offered such services. 

In correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX ; I requested proof of my obligation to pay from both of these organizations. They responded with a letter requesting that I send them a police report for identity theft. I responded with a second letter dated XX/XX/XXXX again requesting validation in the form of ANY application for an account for credit or a contract bearing my signature. They both responded on XX/XX/XXXX with a print out of a bill ; which according to an FTC opinion letter is NOT sufficient proof that a debt belongs to a particular individual. 

According to the FCRA these debts have not been proven to belong to me and should therefore be removed from all 3 credit reporting agencies files. Subsequent requests for the same have not been honored by the credit bureas or by either of these organizations. The credit bureaus continue to report these debts as mine and I have also requested thier Method of Verification for these debts which they have yet to provide. A subsequent complaint regarding the actions or inaction of the 3 major credit bureaus is forthcoming. Additionally, I have a filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) in Wisconsin and am planning to file a complaint with the Texas Attorney General 's Office.",,"Colony Brands, Inc.",TX,797XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2018-02-05,Untimely response,No,N/A,2788361

The loans have been consolidated XX/XX/XXXX to a different servicer.

The negative balance associated with this account was well over {$1000.00}. I was fully unaware of the negative status of this account, and certainly had no idea that it had been charged off. I am still unsure of how it is legal for a bank to allow such an excessive charge to pass through, when there is no money in said account. In the terms of our divorce decree, it is stipulated that any and all debts incurred during the time of our legal separation are the financial responsibility of the party who acquired them. These charges were incurred solely by my ex-husband, and the bank associate even confirmed that it was clear to her, that the only debit card in use was his own personal card. Mine was entirely inactive. Even after calling in and pleading my case with the bank and offering to provide proof in the form of divorce documents, there was no consideration made to removing me from the liability of this debt. This debt affects me in two critical ways : I am unable to obtain any new bank accounts in the future until this debt is fully paid, and secondly, it is strongly impacting my credit score in a negative way.

2018-12-28,Debt collection,Mortgage debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"In XXXX I purchased a condo and the original creditor was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I took out two mortgages for the condo at 80 % on first and 20 % on second. XXXX XXXX was an operating sub of XXXX and both were taken over by Bank of America in XXXX. 

In XXXX I was contacted by Bank of America via mail that I was eligible for loan modifications under the HAMP program. I contacted the using the number on the letter. The agent that I spoke to informed me that I would be eligible but first I needed to quit paying my mortgages. She stated that I needed to contact her in 3 months after non-payment. 

In three months the agent informed me that she would be sending out a modification package in the mail. Upon receiving it I filled it out and she informed me to continue to not pay my mortgages. Several months later in XXXX I received my modification package. The principal on the mortgage was {$110000.00} which was XXXX higher than the original 1st. I asked the agent about the 2nd mortgage and if I would be getting another bill. She replied that as far as she was concerned the 2nd was finished and that I was to ignore any and all bills for the property except the one sent by bank of america. She additionally stated that I would be receiving information in the future settling the 2nd mortgage and that it was going to be extinguished and discharged. She stated that I would be receiving a XXXX for the difference if there was one. 

During the modification process all financial adjustments and payments were reported on bills that were consistent with the XXXX XXXX XXXX statements. Upon completion of the trial period and upon transferring over to bank of america bills for the mortgage I received a statement from XXXX XXXX with regards to the 2nd mortgage that showed that the balance was adjusted to XXXX. It was dated in conjunction to the billing reflected on the first mortgage and the bank of america modification. 

I never received any bill with regard to the 2nd mortgage after the modification was completed. 3-4 years later I received a bill in the mail from a third party company that has been trying to collect. I emphatically deny the legitimacy of this debt. 

At the recorder of deeds it shows that the deed of trust assignment for the first mortgage was transferred to bank of america in XXXX of XXXX yet the 2nd mortgage has remained unchanged since XXXX. 

Upon conducting a title search it is clear that bank of america owns the 2nd mortgage still. I have tried to reach out via phone and email to bank of america only to get canned responses. 

I understand that in the early days of HAMP bank of america was contracting with third party companies to administrate the modifications. I also understand that these companies had poorly trained staff. I speculate that it is quit possible that while the third party organized the information and handed it back to bank of america that it is likely that the documentation was lost or incorrectly filed and that the 2nd mortgage was sold as an unsecured debt to a third party. 

I understand that in XXXX there was a settlement with the department of justice in which bank of america had to correct and amend several decisions that it had made as its practices were in violation of the HAMP program. I would greatly appreciate if Bank of America would take the necessary steps to reply to these issues responsibly so that this can come to a close.

Origin : The E-fraud prevention team from HSBC bank called me on XX/XX/XXXX and wanted me to confirm some recent online activities on my accounts. I missed their phone call initially so I tried to call back that afternoon but the wait time is too long. I finally managed to call them back next morning on XXXX. The representative informed me my accounts was compromised. He went through the unauthorized transactions with me and said only the transaction of {$4000.00} can be recalled immediately and for the rest they will investigate and get back to me in a few days. 

Couple days later I am able to see one transaction ( {$8600.00} ) credited back to my account. I called them for a status on the remaining transactions and they are still working on that. That representative said it would take a maximum of 10 days to get me a final response otherwise will credit full amount back to my accounts. 

On XXXX, I sent a formal letter to HSBC headquarter in XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to notify them that I am a victim of identity theft and never authorize anyone else to use my accounts in any way. This is to protect me in case the bank said I never contact them in written statement about the matter. 

Afterward I called them a couple of times on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to get a status for the remaining transactions, and every time I was told I need to wait few more days to finish their investigation. The last time we spoke on XX/XX/XXXX, they said they need 8-10 more business days to investigate!

Note : Attached is the formal letter I sent to HSBC headquarter using certified mail. The reference number of the case they opened for investigation is : XXXX - XXXX.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,NY,112XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-11-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3084623

Called and asked again. Same thing. No papers. Finally third time she says oh we can't mail forms just the tax form. Meanwhile months have gone by. Getting more behind and won't take any paynents. On my own I finally figure out how to download forms on my cell. Then find out how to fill them in on my cell. Took weeks because print is so small. At no time does this person tell me about refinancing or loan repayment plans only modification.

I told the company that if they would mail me a bill, i would pay for all items I had bought, but would not pay late fees or interest because I believe they fraudulently switched me to online billing. I then cancelled the credit card.

This is creating issues for me such as higher interest rates, lower credit scores, job declines, and application rejects for outstanding balances owed. 

I disputed this account XX/XX/2019 on my XXXX  and XXXX  credit reports to no avail. To date, Barclays Bank Delaware continues to ignore my requests and they continue to ignore my consumer rights.

Who verified this account? What documents did they use to verify? Where are the documents used to verify? 

The only correspondence that I received was a letter informing me they received my dispute. This does not qualify as verification per FCRA. This company is in violation for continuing to verify the account with the credit bureaus without providing the evidence as requested.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",PA,,,Consent provided,Web,2020-01-16,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3498924

2019-01-18,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,"","Opened a HELOC with Ditech in 2007- set payment {$200.00}. Somewhere down the line it ended up with XXXX which was fine, then sold off to Greentree which was a constant problem so I started paying $ 1000-2000 a month just to get it over with but they refused to accept any more payments once I got 12 months ahead of the curve. Say what? You don't want my money? Anyways, Greentree apparently changed the terms of the loan and now I have an escrow account. Two years later I realized it wasn't going away because I was paying homeowners insurance and property taxes twice which ripped me off for over {$6000.00} cuz I wasn't looking. This is when I heard of Greentree / XXXX XXXX Class Action Lawsuit and suddenly I'm back with Ditech ( but with altered terms- escrow ). For the last 3 years I have tried to get Ditech to remove the escrow requirements since they are not my primary mortgage lender. Ditech finally did after some "" legal intervention '' but now charge me a {$6.00} monthly "" servicing '' fee and every year they force place insurance policies on my account and the phone calls start all over again. Hello year # 4. A simple XXXX search revealed a lot I did not know regarding how XXXX  suddenly disappeared during the Class Action and is now Ditech. Thus why I join the ranks of the growing dis-contentment in a public forum. I just want my original terms which I have in writing from 2007 honored and stop all the shenanigans to score a few extra $ $ $ from people who thought they could trust a contract. -XXXX",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Ditech Financial LLC,TX,770XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3127899

I then was connected to this XXXX, who claimed they were about to take me to court. I told them go for it, because they knew I would win. He was outlandish and said he had no problem being recorded. I was harrassed repeatedly to PAY MY BILLS. They stated they had the loan information in front of them, but refused to provide such proof or such information, just "" send us the money! '' after they refused I decided to investigate the Company as it was clear this likely was a sham, and found multiple complaints online filed against ARA Inc, in which the posters stated they recieved almost identical amount demands, identical claims of the bank they had never heard of, and outragious treatment once they tried to make contact. XXXX off of XXXX sight alone with the identical stories.

XXXX XXXX SSN : XXXX | DOB : XX/XX/XXXX Experian XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX I am outraged that your company continues to maintain a dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy as confirmed on my credit report. This unconfirmed, unverified, and dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy has stopped me from obtaining credit. I know for a fact your company receives information on bankruptcy from a third party system known as a XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX is inaccurate and incomplete since the XXXX XXXX does not provide complete social security numbers as that would be against the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy Laws. Furthermore, I have been in contact with the county courthouse and they also assured me they do not report full social security numbers to thirty parties or make social security numbers public record. Even though it is your company 's policy to keep reporting a bankruptcy that is filed, dismissed, or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681 ( c ) relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law is very clear and states from the date of adjudication or date of order of relief. 

Any case, whether it be civil or otherwise, once dismissed it no longer exists in the eyes of the law. This case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. You have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed non-existent. It is only fair that in accordance with section 1618 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act you delete this from my credit report and send me an updated copy.

Considering this does not require an investigation, I would appreciate an updated copy of my credit report showing no bankruptcy within two weeks from the date you receive this letter.

Attached is a copy of my most recent mortgage statement dated XX/XX/2019 which references a reinstatement amount. ( Attached - PDF Reference 1 ) I have the ability and am prepared to make such payment in a single installment to being this loan current, although such action requires an updated quote from you. ( Attached PDF - Reference 2 ) Additionally, the mortgage statement makes reference that this amount consists of unpaid advance disbursements but does not fully itemize these amounts. ( Attached PDF - Reference 3 ) This property was subject of a foreclosure sale by Sale Committee on XX/XX/2019, although the report of the Committee has not been marked for judicial consideration ( potential approval ) until XX/XX/2019. 

Finally, there appear to be irregularities in the conduct of your legal counsel within this process with respect to Connecticut General Statue 49-31s regarding the concurrent filing of motions for default and judgment upon non-appearing parties. 

Such concurrent filings might be permitted for instances of abandoned or unoccupied residential buildings, however despite the repeated placement of "" XXXX - Vacant '' stickers on an accessory ( storage/garage ) building on the property, there seems to exist no other evidence or rationale to think that this single family home actively occupied by the mortgagor ( me ) had somehow become abandoned property. 

Given the deficiencies in service and process upon me which resulted from this ( apparently ) erroneous application of the accelerated timeline, I ask for ability to reinstate this loan and request such calculation of the reinstatement payment amount in accordance with Connecticut General Statue 49-10a. 

Such payment would be made direct to your organization in single installment within 3 business days of receipt.

They said that the bill was from XX/XX/2013 but could not tell me what the phone number was attached to the bill. I then explained to them that I have been a XXXX customer in good standing for over 15 years and that my monthly payments are automatically deducted from my bank account, and that this wasnt my bill. 

I questioned them as to how they could put this on my credit report without ever sending me a bill. They couldnt answer that question. The person I spoke said that they would send me out a form to dispute the bill. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX with a form included to file a fraud complainant with XXXX. I had never once said that fraud had been committed. I then took this information and went to XXXX and had them look up the account in question. They informed me that there was no record of the account other than that it was turned over to XXXX. XXXX informed me that XXXX had all of the documentation associated with the account in question. 
When I spoke with a representative at XXXX they informed me that they had nothing either, just that they had bought the debt from somewhere. Since I got nowhere with XXXX or XXXX I filed a dispute through all three credit reporting agencies. They all came back that the account was valid. 

I have never received anything from this company ( XXXX  ) no bills no statements nothing. I am at a loss as to how a company can put something on your credit report without validating the debt, even when I spoke with them on the phone they had nothing to establish that the debt was mine. I had a credit score of over 750 before they added this account, by adding this they dropped my score by 85 points which was very damaging to my credit. I am not sure how they can do that.

I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3380692

2019-08-06,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"","We started a mortgage process with TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX, to purchase a condo in XXXX, NY for my daughters. We never shopped around because my daughter was very happy with TD services in the past 10 years. At the beginning, they offered a 30 year old mortgage with no points at 3.5 % fixed rate. Upon request, we provided all necessary documents TD asked for and through-out the process, we requested the closing to take place by XX/XX/XXXX since my daughters had to move out of their current apartment as others were scheduled to move in the next day. TD Bank consistently assured us that the closing WILL take place on time. To our surprise, a week before the closing date, TD started asking for the same documents that we had provided and waited to the last week for employment verification which they couldve done at the very beginning. The loan officer apologized for late handling and processing the case via email and phone calls. TD abject failure to deliver what was promised, caused the closing date to be postponed TWICE which caused us extreme hardship and added costs of living in a hotel for 4 nights and I had to postpone my flight twice. 
But, the most egregious part of the entire ordeal was when TD Bank inexplicably increased the interest rate to 4 % even-though we had a locked-in rate of 3.625 %, literally two days before the closing and after hundreds of phone calls, emails and texts begging them to honor what was agreed upon, they wouldnt budge and presented some bogus and questionable reasoning and justification. We strongly feel that TD kept us hostage and knowing that we had our belongings in a truck and living in a hotel, we had no other choice but to accept their unfair deal since we couldnt walk away. This was nothing but an extortion which I brought up to the attention of most TD staff including the Regional Sales Manger, but they couldnt care less. 
We even asked for some type of compensation for our additional expenses by a way of waving or reducing some of their fees and charges to no avail. 
Most attorneys and people involved at the closing which finally took place on XX/XX/XXXX, five days later than promised, all had negative comments about TD services due to their past experiences, particularly TD Mortgage Division.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-08-06,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3331820

2019-03-17,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Public record information inaccurate,"My husband and I were trying to refinance our home in XXXX, XXXX when we were made aware of an issue on our Equifax report. Our Equifax report listed two bankruptcies ; one in XXXX of XXXX filed with a local court, a true bankruptcy that we did indeed file, and another in XXXX with the same filing number, information, etc. but filed in a different court in a city we had never visited. We of course tried to contact Equifax regarding this information. They did update our credit report, but still listed both bankruptcies with the same filing information. The only thing they changed was the date. Both bankruptcies now have the same true date of filing, but show different counties. This of course has caused issues for us in terms of refinancing as it now looks like we have two bankruptcies on our history. I tried to contact the court at the number Equifax used to "" verify '' the information. The number, XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, is not in service. I actually called this exact number a second time while on the phone with an Equifax representative trying to prove that there was no way they used that phone number to verify the incorrect information and was told "" I should look for another number ''. I further asked how else they were able to contact to verify the information, and they only gave me a physical address. I asked them again how else they were able to verify the information, as I knew they did not personally visit the location, and I was told to look for another contact number. 

I did some research on the secondary filing location of XXXX County. This bankruptcy court has been closed since XXXX, a year before we actually even filed for bankruptcy ( XXXX ), and 3 years before Equifax accepted a new filing from that address ( XXXX ). Upon further investigation and reaching out to people to help, we have learned that this is a very common issue with Equifax. I have emails from a clerk of courts that state that numerous people have had the same issue with Equifax claiming this closed court as a viable entity and accepting bankruptcies from this court address. 

I have spent countless hours on the phone trying to get this fixed. It has been suggested by Equifax representatives and per their advertising while on hold, that we pay for a credit repair service to help us correct this issue. I even had an online message via XXXX messenger from XXXX XXXX stating that a senior representative would be contacting me. This message was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and I have yet to receive any additional contact. I do continue to receive emails that my claim has been looked at, but can no longer login to my Equifax account because my personal information, the same information I use to contact a representative live, does not match their records. I have, of course, called and the only resolution they have come to is that they verified the false bankruptcy court and changed the date of filing. 

I feel like this has been an ongoing issue for consumers like me. The fact that this bankruptcy court has been closed for 6 years and that Equifax is allowing "" verified reports '' from it, is ridiculous. Additionally, the fact that they could not actually give me anyway in which they truly "" verified '' the information, other than a disconnected phone number is VERY disturbing. Our credit is being held hostage and we have no way to negate what Equifax is reporting. Also, the fact that it was constantly suggested via their advertising and through their own agents that we should go through their "" preferred partner '', XXXX, further incites me, as people should not have to pay to have fraudulent/unverifiable information removed from THEIR personal credit report.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NC,27592,,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3182509

2019-08-29,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","My Challenge in a nut shell is the servicing lenders sell the contract and dont apply the payments correctly. 

This is the third time this has happened in 2 years. I send the servicing folks emails and call and then get a reply they have 30 days to get back to me and dont. 

This started in XX/XX/XXXX when Selene finance took over my Mortgage payment. Selene Finance wrote I was behind 90 days and if I didnt pay they would foreclose on my home. 

However the previous lender received XXXX for property taxes, mortgage payments in XXXX. In the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Selene finance said I had to take it up with that company this is what I owed. So I did pay them all the payments. But because I had waited on trying to get the funds placed property I was assessed "" property Assessment '' of XXXX to XXXX charges every week. 

After I paid the 90 days of payments and excessive fees I signed the mortgage contracts to have ACH withdrawal. However 2 days later I called and stopped the ACH withdrawal from XXXX and then I called and places stop payments for the ACH withdrawals. I was nervous the payments would not be placed correctly since I was over paying to go to interest. 

Unfortunately Selene finance Did not stop the ACH withdrawal so I did at my bank. This caused all the OD fees that were not OD fees but cancelled ACH pulls. Selene would auto pay my account it gets rejected as a stop payment and I get tagged XXXX they then would pull again the next day same thing XXXX in fees rejected. 

My Bill pay checks would put on the account with the extra funds to go to OD fees or property assessment fees. Instead of to interest. 

I would call, Selene customer Service phone person, would say resubmit I would, then I would get charges XXXX for each Bank charge from them saying NSF when it was not NSF but they sent back. I have times I called, who I spoke with including follow-up emails. After 6 months of this I finally was able to get a hold of a supervisor who went thru the account with me reversed the XXXX od fees places the extra payments correctly and revered the XXXX property assessment fees. 

All goes well until XXXX of XXXX when check was sent back, attached ...

XXXX  and XXXX  both have removed the public record ... .why are you still causing me harm and damage? 

The New Jersey class action claimed Equifax violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by sending letters that falsely told consumers that it confirms the veracity of disputed public-record information by contacting the source a county court, in this instance directly. 
In reality, however, Equifax never directly contacts the public-information sources, and uses a third-party company to investigate the disputed information, the suit claimed. 
In response to a consumers dispute regarding the accuracy of a public record, it [ Equifax ] never contacts the original source of the information, but rather contacts the private independent company that it never discloses to the consumer, according to the suit. 
Under a settlement agreement given final approval by U.S. District Judge XXXX XXXX Wednesday, Equifax will not represent that the government and/or any court or courthouse is a furnisher of information in response to a consumers dispute ; will not represent that the government and/or any court or courthouse was contacted directly by Equifax in connection with any consumers dispute ; and will not represent that the government and/or any court or courthouse actually investigated a consumers dispute.

I paid down a significant amount on the balance. I owed only XXXX dollars. When I traded up to a new wedding ring set this past year, a different account was opened under my name but with my spouse as joint. We were quoted a new minimum monthly payment of XXXX dollars with a new balance under 7500 but the very first billing statement from XXXX XXXX  stated XXXX dollars as the new balance with the first minimum payment of XXXX dollars! I immediately disputed this amount along with the balance. A 60 day investigation was opened and XXXX XXXX informed me I would not be charged additional interest fees during this time. When the investigation was complete, I was still charged interest and the balance increased well over 1000 dollars. XXXX wanted me to pay XXXX as the very first payment on the account. I tried to resolve this with XXXX XXXX and leaned I was being charged double interest and double monthly payments on two separate balances! My spouse and I were not informed of these terms In-Store by the Assistant and Store Managers. We also did not agree to these terms. I was never given a copy of my new account contract, only my Sales Receipt that showed XXXX dollars as a minimum monthly payment. I tried to return my new wedding ring set but XXXX XXXX Corporate refused to take it back and XXXX XXXX  still wanted XXXX dollars I did not owe them! XXXX XXXX and XXXX continued to call my phone from restricted numbers, so I asked for a Cease and Desist.

2019-02-26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"","On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX I made arrangements with the so called Sr. loan officer at Fortren Funding located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX to refinance my mortgage and ever since then I have been complaining because they think their swift in covering up costly numbers for their clients and am fully on to their scheme in robbing innocent families with outstanding credit, then destroy them with phony personnel. It started when XXXX XXXX told me to stop making payments to my current lender at ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX at this point XXXX XXXX  stated to me to let my new LENDER know that they will not pay my taxes for the 1st quarter. I let XXXX know about this and at first it was OK. and after mid month I received a late payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then contacted XXXX and XXXX XXXX another sales manager who went over my documentation to clarify my credit history and sign docs to qualify for the loan and had an XXXX credit score.So I cancelled ... This is when XXXX contacted me and said "" no '' don't cancel because it was only a matter of my tax payment that the title company refused to pay up front for me to start my escrow account. However, we can start the process again the following month because there is still time before my 1st quarter taxes were due and I will submit the same contract again with no closing cost to you and don't worry about the late fee because you are still saving 2 hundred a month to keep your 2nd home. I said "" please put this in writing and e-mail me that info ... and he did so ''. XXXX then instructed a Title company named XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time located in XXXX nj to arrange documentation on what we discussed And when XXXX XXXX arrived to my home on the evening mentioned XX/XX/XXXX she arrived with the HUD and we signed documents together as well as an unpaid hospice bill that appeared under my Dad 's name before he passed away in XXXX and simply had this removed from damaging my credit by notarizing that I was solely XXXX XXXX XXXX not XXXX ... And discussed like XXXX had mentioned to me that "" although he said, "" that there is no additional closing cost..there will be 500.00 from out of pocket expenses for the title agent and other fee if I can come up with XXXX with a cashier 's check to meet the tax deadline, since I will be skipping 2 monthly payments and receiving a disbursement check "" from my old lender ( XXXX XXXX ) for the amount of 1900 and change but not until LATER in XXXX since my old escrow account is being washed. and there we go XXXX stated, I also asked XXXX about the XXXX being the tax deadline and questioned how taxes were being paid and XXXX stated, they had to be escrowed into mortgage account from title company for recording and mentioned that it's a refinance and a few days late will not effect anything maybe a few extra dollars. He also told me to remember that we were brother 's being that were both from the same town 1 mile apart. At this time XXXX told both myself and my girlfriend that this cashier 's check is strictly for my tax payment and nothing else and attached it with the 1st payment letter on the HUD and mentioned again "" for taxes only! '' as she held it up to us. And this is where it does get tricky because the actual contract on the HUD realize is the original contract from when XXXX then XXXX stepped in as the Sr. loan officer to service the majority of this loan, XXXX or known as XXXX started the contract to approve my loan. So being numbers were left the same from the previous month evidently there has been a history of confusion and me and my family had to sacrifice over what XXXX had mentioned was a HUGE mistake and would have this problem handled ASAP for me when I contacted him by XX/XX/XXXX and asked him why only partial payment was made towards my taxes? I contacted him a few weeks later and told him that my taxes were still due but not delinquent and will have to pay on my own since I had a ton of money at that time. XXXX and my township asked why should I if I already escrowed them? And my town stated that they will put a yellow sticker on? XXXX said he checked again and they would be paying them soon. By the following year of XX/XX/XXXX I was receiving odd e-mails about unauthorized payments from my checking account for late payments from XXXX XXXX located over seas where all negative information was recorded to my credit history as well as the unpaid lien that was from my father 's and had to pay numerous penalties and fees for this error. By XX/XX/XXXX my car payment drastically increased along with my mortgage payment costing me an extra cost of living of 300.00 per month with an escrow shortage and canceled credit card. When I contacted XXXX he asked me who paid my taxes? I told him XXXX and he did not say anything but he will get back. I called again and this is when he disconnected his phone. I finally called in XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to anther man XXXX XXXX who I never met and would not know what XXXX and I actually arranged. So he stated that he was taking charge of this loan and took a look at it and asked if this was a no appraisal fee and skipping 2 payments I said yes. he then asked me if I received a disbursement check? I said yes, then XXXX asked what did I do with it? spend it! I said yes towards my 1st 2 voucher payments made to fortren funding in the amount of XXXX when my payments were less than that amount and ended up with an escrow shortage after the 1st analysis came due from the negligence from the originators from what I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX and went directly to a credit service then sold to them delinquent after contacting their ombudsman dept. XXXX then told me it was too late to make any changes and not to have no more contact with them because no one is here to help me except my current lender who ever they were because my loan got all screwed up. By the time it was then sold to XXXX XXXX   my current lender I was and have been facing more escrow shortages, late payments diminished credit score and had to sell my second home and became XXXX because I thought this was a temporary mishap. And having no choice than to pay the losses to avoid losing my primary residence. By the summer of XXXX I was facing XXXX losses and submitting many complaints but the damages at that time were not severe enough for me to pursue and I received a phone call from a third party at Fortren Funding XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX and he told me that XXXX is no longer available to explain how this loan fell out of my favor and would be too costly in court with all of the banks handling my loan and suggested that I request a loan modification where that would reduce my interest another point and any liens that were recorded would be forgotten and that none of these consumer complaints believe me because the XXXX messed up the paperwork. I knew that this was another false misrepresentation so I reported all of this to my current lender. I also did contact other authorities. An experienced Sr.loan officer with my credit history and the HUD presented to them is self explanatory with the 48th month history if examining, the timing of the disbursement check which I was accused of spending towards my taxes ... HUD 1 settlement statement lines XXXX fees XXXX line XXXX taxes ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX with tax certificate showing that taxes were open for XX/XX/XXXX on the evening at closing. And the payoff to my former lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) At this time of course everyone involved has avoided any involvement in this criteria and are probably out there in other offices after closing down. Hopefully this will give a clearer picture how these people who can not maintain their own lives, careers and jobs, families etc.It 's the people who work hard like my father did and I who have outstanding credit and a work history of 39 straight years in the work force until I had to work harder at XXXX years old for what started as a simple mistake. And myself being a homeowner 2 telling me how to  handle my money ... hopefully justice is served for all of them!",,Fortren Funding LLC,NJ,07470,,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-11,Untimely response,No,N/A,3163791

I already disputed this with the credit bureaus and they verified it as being accurate. I am not sure how this happened, I |thought that I had made my payments to you on time when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me or maybe an error occurred where it wasn't recorded on time. 

I do ask in light of the good standing relationship we have that you remove any late payments from my credit report and refund me any late fees that were added to my account. I do not believe it is accurate. 

I would rather not have to spend more time than necessary for both of us to resolve this situation so I was hoping that instead of escalating anything, that you could help me with this and report me as being 100 % on time. 

I appreciate your help regarding this and look forward to keep having the positive experience that I have had with you in the past.

I, XXXX XXXX, had lost my job in XXXX. Notified the mortgage lender, HSBC, of the matter. I didn't land a job until approximately 3 months later, informed HSBC that I will began making payments in doubles until I was caught up, however, they had told me that there was a new policy stating that the whole past due amount ( totaling appx. 5000.00 dollars ) would need to be paid. Furthermore, no payment smaller than the past due amount would be accepted. 

At that time, it was winter going into spring, in XXXX New York. Therefore, I was behind in the heat and electricity, the car loan, and owed back payments in child support. There was no way for me to be able to pay the amount that was requested by HSBC. Hence, the house ended up in foreclosure. I could not afford a lawyer, at that time and still can not. 

After many phone calls, and time passing, the loan that had plagued my life, had been closed. The house was sold in an auction in XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, according to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( contact info : XXXX ). Although, on my credit report it shows that the account had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not understand how they had closed the account on this date when I was still making payments until I was unemployed. To make matters more confusing, this Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice via XXXX XXXX stating that I owe HSBC a past balance of {$120000.00} dollars, yet the loan was for {$55000.00}. Even more confusing is that it states that I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I WAS LIVING IN XXXX!!!!!!!! THE HOUSE WAS SOLD ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE THEN!!! WHICH, I HAD NO PRIOR INFORMATION ABOUT!!!!!

2019-04-26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","We called Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to get a payoff on our mortgage on XX/XX/, the account representative pulled the payoff in the amount of {$450.00}. The representative advised us that we could not transfer the money online ourselves and advised that she would handle this on the bank side. She got the account information but she entered the information for the account number wrong. OnXX/XX/XXXX my husband realized the amount never came out of our Wells Fargo checking account and called Wells Fargo back to find out why. The representative acknowledged their error and fixed the account draft and processed it correctly. The XXXX cleared our bank account on XX/XX/. 

On XX/XX/, we called Wells Fargo to check on our satisfaction of our lien that had not been processed with the XXXX County Register of Deeds. In NC there is a 30 day requirement to release a lien. The representative advised that they showed the lien had not been released and would send an urgent request to the lien release department to XXXX this paperwork. We were told that a representative would call me with this information. We received no call back. On XX/XX/, we called Wells Fargo back and were advised no additional work had been processed by the lien release department. A case was opened with the executive escalation department. OnXX/XX/XXXX, we called the executive department and received no updates to our request. Around XXXX the same day, a representative named XXXX from Wells called to say he was handling our request. He proceeded to state that my loan was not paid off and that I still owed {$450.00} since the first automatic draft did not complete. While on the phone, we pulled up our bank account and gave the cleared date of our draft. He proceeded to disagree with me even though he had no access to look at our Wells Fargo checking account. We are in receipt of a final payoff letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/ stating our account is paid in full. Our online banking confirms our mortgage account is paid in full. 

Here is our deed information {$160000.00}. Book 2494 page 1761 - 1782 datedXX/XX/XXXX. There is an extreme disconnect from the generation of a payoff letter and processing the release that needs to be investigated.

PRA disconnected, and I stayed on with XXXX and asked if they would be able to see ANY old collections. Rep. said she would be able to see any OLD collections ...

2018-12-10,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,I added my son to my NFCU business account as an authorized user about 2 years ago or so. He was added with no problem. Today XX/XX/2018 my business assets are frozen because he owes them money and they blocked me out of my own business accounts. Apparently he owes them over {$5000.00} and they restricted my account because according ti them they can do that. My son went into a branch as was grossly discriminated against and treated like a criminal when I sent him to get a cashiers check. He has called in several times with me and they have been rude and We have been hung up on and when trying to speak to a supervisor I am advised that there is no one working that someone will return my call in 24 to 48 hours. According to what I know these accounts are from XX/XX/2010 and they are declining to forward information to validate the debt. On the recorded line the rep insisted he say that He acknowledge that he owes the money after repeated attempts by the rep in their recovery she hung up and became rude. By them restricting access to my buainess account it will cost me a total of about XXXX to XXXX in fees and other legal costs because of that. My business should not be responsible of them not verifying his information when I added him over 2 years ago. They should have said no of instead taking opportunity to try to collect on a business account that frankly he is only authorized to go when I am not available. I feel that these actions were initiated as a retaliation because they made me go through hoops about a code word on the account and because I stated that I would report them to the proper authorities.,Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,AZ,853XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3096884

Instead the monthly interest is being added to the principal amount so that the principal increases monthly thereby increasing the accrued interest. Consequently, Chase is charging interest on interest every month by increasing the principal when monthly payments more than cover the interest and minimum payment due. 
XXXX informed me that although this is unfair to me, Chase does this per federal law without stating which federal law or offering to provide a copy of the federal law. He further refused to elevate this matter to his supervisor or provide an address for me to submit a written complaint. 
This is wrong. When monthly payments more than cover the minimum payment and interest payments, Chase can not be increasing the principal amount by adding monthly interest amounts to the principal balance to impose higher interest obligations on the consumer. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, the interest on the promotion interest balance has increased due to Chases practice of increasing the principal balance by adding the monthly interest to the principal and NOT applying the monthly payment to the monthly interest charged. 
I do not believe Congress intended for Chase to legally charge interest on top of interest by allowing Chase to increase a principal balance by not applying consumers payments to the interest charged every month",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,VA,221XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3157691

2019-09-19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,"","Dear Senator XXXX, AGO XXXX and Consumer Protection Bureau via Complaint ID # XXXX As your offices are aware, we have experienced deplorable customer service from JPMorgan Chase on our home mortgage and line of credit since XX/XX/XXXX. 

We are seniors and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MA XXXX, has been our primary residence since XX/XX/XXXX. We purchased our home on no doc through Washington Mutual. Chase took over the loan in XX/XX/XXXX and we refinanced from a 30 year fixed to a 15 year fixed mortgage Chase in XX/XX/XXXX. At the closing, Chase asked if we wanted a $ XXXX line of credit. We elected to accept only $ XXXX at the time, which was not accessed until XX/XX/XXXX. In  late XX/XX/XXXX, Chase invited us to increase our HELOC line from the $ XXXX to $ XXXX, but at an increase of 2 % on the entire balance. Going through the financial crisis causing negative Government effect on my FCC Broadcast ownership, XXXX and XXXX children in college, we accepted going forward with the new terms. Chase then delayed for months stating our home value decreased and despite adequate funds in the bank and questioned amount of money I was taking from my owned radio station XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase finally dictated to us that our only option was modification but we had to skip two payments to be considered. 

Chase then reported us to the credit bureaus and the modification approval for the stated 60 months finally came in XX/XX/XXXX, but extended only 42 months with a balloon payment for the full mortgage due XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, Chase miscoded a bank routing number on a payment and then took months to determine it was their error. Then, Chase interrupted our applications for new financing by starting foreclosure notices. Chase further delayed and hindered our efforts to change lenders. 

Finally, after finally being put in touch with the Chase Executive Office in XX/XX/XXXX,  Chase agreed, in XX/XX/XXXX to a second modification at our out of pocket cost of {$36000.00}. Chase refused to spread that amount over the ensuing 200 payments in the second modification. 

In both XX/XX/XXXX and upon our XX/XX/XXXX approval of the second modification, Chase promised to A ) adjust late fees, interest charges and legal fees, B ) make sure the credit bureaus knew we were up to date on the mortgage & HELOC, C ) correct Chases superficial appraisal of our home which is at least $ XXXX too low - $ XXXX compared to a complete modification performed by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at $ XXXX - and D ) make arrangements to finally add to our line of credit. E ) The rate of interest on the new modification is quite high, 4.87 %. 

We continue to get lip service, run around, rude correspondence and phone conversation from Chase. The letters they have sent to me and your offices have no credibility as they do not address Chase mistakes and the horrible, inappropriate manner of customer service from Chase. The Chase letters repeat their old decisions that were incorrect in the first place. 

We are seniors, never bankrupt, with a Chase debt of less than $ XXXX on our primary/only residence HUD and the CPB valued several months ago at over {$1.00} million. Chase is disregarding the importance of our Senior Financial Health and discriminating against seniors ability to have simple access to less than 49 % of their home equity for medical, improvement, college and living expenses. Further, Chase has been rude and tremendously challenged in delaying proceedings. Chase representatives stall, take months to say its not this department and have told us to find another lender, get a reverse mortgage or move! 

With a tremendous amount of phone, email, letter, fax correspondence shared with your offices and Chase, I must ask that you now step in and hold Chase accountable for this harmful, stressful, prolonged and costly behavior negatively affecting us, and other senior customers. We ask for all fee and interest adjustments and for a favorable arrangement to have access to up to 49 % of our home FMV, without further delay. 

Please respond and thank you for protecting senior citizens who need and deserve your intervention.

There was an incident that happened with my company and the merchant that was involved to receive my payments so they could ship the products to my customers but they canceled the transaction prior when the purchased occurred. 

However, I have contacted the merchant company which was XXXX to asked what happened after a couple of days without my knowledge of knowing what had happened. I recall one of the customer service said the transaction was canceled within 24 hours so which clearly means the products didn't get fulfilled for my customers.

From this point I'm confident that they will release/refund my money which they did, they simply refunded within 72 hours. So which means banks release the money within 3-5 business days to my account.

I have waited for more than 10 days, I was like maybe something went wrong with the merchant so I contacted them and they said usually this takes 3-20 business days, so I'm satisfied and moved on with my month, 30 days passed and still, nothing is happening. I definitely contacted the bank and told them that I still didn't receive the money. 

I filed a claim dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. The bank reached out to the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX. Literary the bank took that much time to reach out, their word was "" 90 days '' to get this solved. 90 days passed around XX/XX/XXXX, and they said : "" we have to wait until 90 days for the merchant to get back to us. '' What totally made me reach out to you guys was, this has been almost more than 100 days since when they said "" 90 days '' for the consumer, not the merchant. 

I would like my funds back. All I wanted was them to push that button and release my money to my account since the merchant already refunded me. I lost my trust with Bank Of America, I would like you guys to come in and help me with this case because they clearly give zero XXXX for the customers.

2019-02-19,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"","We entered into a loan modification application process with Wells Fargo on our FHA Rehab mortgage in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. We provided all requested documentation and were approved, and given a lower monthly payment on a 90 day trial period. No information was given as to how they arrived at this payment, or what would happen for them to achieve this payment amount, until AFTER we paid 3 months of trial payments. 

We made the first two trial period payments and Wells Fargo sent us a letter that we'd been removed from the program. I called them and found out they had sent us a letter that we had to sign and send back agreeing to the trial period. They didn't tell us it would be coming or required and it was apparently sent via regular mail, not certified or overnighted, and we never received it. That's 2 payments made. 

So they started us over again, new trial period, and we made 3 payments in XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. That's 5 trial period payments we made at that point. We received an email that we'd been approved for the HAMP modification and would be receiving paperwork that we would need to have notarized and sent back. No details as to what it was or any figures. Just an approval email. 

We received an overnight packet from XXXX  with the modification paperwork and figures. I called in to Wells Fargo after looking over the numbers, and I wanted a detailed itemization of the figures that they came up with to modify the loan. My foreclosure "" specialist '' could not answer these simple questions - even though all the numbers are there in their computer system. She got belligerent with me on the phone about how I "" better make the payment '', etc ... I sent several emails and left voicemails with ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE back. NO email responses from her, NO letters in the mail, NO return phone calls. 

I called and made another payment over the phone with someone else on XX/XX/XXXX ( after no explanations, no responses and no calls returned ), and then on XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a letter in the mail that they "" are no longer moving forward with the HAMP program '' for our account. 

A few days later, I receive a letter from their foreclosure attorney, and last Thursday, the sheriff posted the court documents on my front door that state our foreclosure hearing is set with the county on  XX/XX/XXXX. 

We qualified for, and were approved for, a HAMP loan modification. We did not however, know what was involved prior to the trial period payments - only what the payment itself would be. 

I am not happy with the modification numbers and did not sign the documents that were sent to me, instead I wanted to work with my mortgage company to see if there was an alternative, but they REFUSE TO RESPOND and now have us set for foreclosure. I feel my rights as a consumer have been violated by the mortgage company refusing to answer questions or explain their figures, which I believe are double-dipping, and possibly fraudulent or illegal.

I have all emails I sent to the foreclosure "" specialist '' and records of calls and voicemails left that were never returned. Every letter the specialist ever sent clearly stated "" please call me if you have any questions ''. I had questions - she refused to answer them, and then refused to respond altogether. She removed us from the program instead. Even though we qualified for assistance. I just want to verify the numbers before signing - because they show that we will end up owing more than we started with after making three years ' worth of payments. And they were increasing our interest rate, not lowering it. They took a chunk of the principal balance and "" amount in deliquency '' ( the number they refused to explain how they arrived at it ) and are setting it out as a perpetual silent second mortgage that will never be paid down or paid off until we sell or refinance the property. At which time, WF will receive all of that money - double dipping when they get it. We were not given any other option as far as lower interest rate, extended term of the mortgage, nothing.

And now, thanks to WF XXXX us around, we're even further behind in the payments. This should have been handled in a timely manner and it was NOT. It's been over 90 days since I made the 3rd payment of the trial period, and I made an additional payment last month in XXXX after not hearing anything from them. Now that they've set a court hearing, they won't accept another payment from me, and that will cause more months to go behind. 

On top of that, this company receives millions of dollars in HAMP funds each year to help people struggling with their payments - there is no evidence in these numbers that ANY HAMP funds were being used to help us. I'm not asking for free money, but if the government intends those funds to be used to help people, and WF isn't using them to do just that, then WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THOSE MILLIONS ( WILL BE BILLIONS BY XXXX WHEN IT ENDS ) OF DOLLARS IN HAMP FUNDS? Are they just eating that money? My trial payment letter clearly states we were in a HAMP loan modification. But every dollar is showing it's coming from us in the end, not HAMP funds at all. And now, the HAMP program is no longer accepting applications? 

I don't know where to turn at this point. But I believe this is an illegal foreclosure. We did everything they asked us to do, and we had every right to question the numbers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NC,271XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,2019-02-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3155728

2019-01-08,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"","I have a loan with Seterus. My ex husband was the primary on the mortgage. We are divorced, he has moved out of the country and can not be found since XX/XX/XXXX.I am in the deed of the home, my ex husband provided a quit-claim-deed which was included in our divorce. I am in charge of paying the mortgage and the sole owner. I fell behind 2 years ago. I have been working back and forth with Seterus for a loan modification as well as an assumption for the loan. Over the last two years I have sent numerous request for mortgage assistance packages. I was approved once, given a new outstanding principal. I asked them in writing several times to please explain to me how they came out with the new principal. They refused and took away the trail modification. Here is a brief history of what has happened: XX/XX/XXXXI placed a complaint here with the CFPBXX/XX/XXXX I, along with the help of a HUD counselor, sent request to fully assume the mortgage. Also send a new RMA for the mortgage delinquency XX/XX/XXXX Approved for a trial payment. The trial payment documents had my ex husband name and not me. The trial payments were for the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, andXX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Seterus informs me the updated request was received to assume the loan and they are reviewing itXX/XX/XXXX Request for the assumption denied. Seterus sends letter stating not all documentation was received. The letter did not specify what was missing. I called and was informed I needed to send deed and quit-claim-deed. I informed them it was previously sent but I sent it again (3rd time)XX/XX/XXXX I was informed I was approved as a successor by letter from SeterusXX/XX/XXXX Seterus sends me the official assumption offer to sign. I completed it and sent it back the same dayXX/XX/XXXX I sent my last trial modification payment. All trial payments were done on time. XX/XX/XXXX I was sent a permanent modification to review and sign. All the documents had the name of my ex husband and not me. I called stating that the name of he mortgage is wrong. I was told by Seterus that they made a mistake. They will resend the documents with my name included. I was also told that my ex husband's name will still be in the paperwork but to ignore it, and just sign under my name.XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXXI followed up several times with Seterus during this time. Every time I was told that they are working on it. No information was sent to me by letter stating that fact. Every time I call I am told different stories on what is happening. Seterus refuses to send me information by letter.XX/XX/XXXX I received another package for a permanent modification. This permanent modification STILL has my ex husband's name and still does not have my name anywhere in the documents. I called Seterus again. I am told that there was another error and they will be fixing it. XX/XX/XXXXI called Seterus for an update. I am told over the phone that they are working on it. I asked how much longer since it has been a year almost since I was approved for the modification and 6 months since I was approved for the assumption. I am told it may take a long time and they do not have a time frame to give meXX/XX/XXXXI meet with a HUD counselor from New Jersey XXXX XXXX. We called Seterus. We spoke with a representative who refused to talk to my HUD counselor. The representative said that I am not authorized to let Seterus speak with my counselor because I am a third party. I asked several times to please look at the notes in their and they will see that I am not a third party. The representative refused to look at the notes and said she knows I am not authorized. I asked once again what is the status of the permanent modification. The representative for Seterus said it is being reviewed. I asked to please send me something in a letter stating they are reviewing it. The representative said no. I asked several times for something in writing just indicating they are reviewing it. The representative put me on hold several times to speak with her supervisor. They said I do not have the right to receive anything, they do not have to send anything. I can send something in writing to them asking them to respond. That is what has happened since my last complaint to the CFPB. I have letters for all the above dates and prove from Seterus.I am not sure what is happening but I know that Seterus has pretty much taken a year of my life running around, missing work, stressing, not sleeping, and over and over refusing to due the bare minimum.

The mortgage was fraudulent upon issuing. Pursuant to 10 PA Code Section 48.3, the company issuing the mortgage used and provided fraudulent information contained in these sections of the PA code : ( 1 ) A dishonest practice or conduct is characterized by a lack of truth, honesty or trustworthiness, or is deceptive or implies a willful perversion of the truth to deceive, cheat, or defraud. ( 2 ) A fraudulent practice or conduct is characterized by deceit or trickery, an intentional perversion of the truth to induce another to part with something of value or to surrender a legal right, or an act of deceiving or misrepresenting. Fraud also includes any other  definition of fraud under applicable law. Example A : A mortgage originator employed by a mortgage broker has promised a certain low-rate mortgage loan to a consumer. However, the consumer does not have the minimum debt-to-income ratio set by the lender preferred by the mortgage originators employer to qualify for the lowest-rate mortgage loan offered. Therefore, the mortgage originator changes the XXXX statement of the consumer to reflect a higher income for the consumer without the consumers knowledge, and then submits the documentation to the lender. Example B : An employee of a mortgage lender contacts a real estate appraiser with a request to perform an appraisal and informs the appraiser that the sale price of the property is {$150000.00}. The employee knows that the property will not appraise for that amount, but promises the appraiser future business if the appraiser can make the deal work. The mortgage loan is closed by the mortgage lender based upon the appraisal report showing the value of the property as {$150000.00}. I was tricked into this mortgage during desperate times. The interest rate is 9.75 % fixed. I had been paying interest-only for 10 years, and in XXXX I was required to start paying principal and interest.

Anytime I make an additional payment they somehow administratively XXXX up the payment to be disbursed to the wrong loan. 

The loan is a Consolidated Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loan. They have a system set up on their website to allocate funds to a specific loan ( i.e. highest current balance, highest current interest ratel, or prorate across selected loans etc. ). I want to pay my loans off as fast as possible, so I have chosen to submit additional payments to the the Consolidated Subsidized loan, which has the least amount of principal left. 

Anytime I make an additional payment, I have to call them and correct their mistake because they will always split the additional payment between the Subsidized and Unsubsidized Consolidated loan. After calling them and having the additional payment made to the Subsized Loan, they automatically prorate the next payment, so my automatic payment isn't being distributed the way I want as well. I spoke to them on the phone and requested they not do that, but do it every time. 

It seems their website has a system in place to help the user, but their system isn't functioning properly when you choose what you want. 

Also, it seems silly that I need to take time out of my day consistently to make sure they are applying my additional payments to a loan I have specified to them numerous times.

He promised the close date is XX/XX/2018 until XX/XX/2018, he told me because the confirmation of my XXXX status, he could only submit he project review on XX/XX/2018 and my loan would be delayed to be closed on XX/XX/2018. 

At that time, I already give notice to the landlord which means I must move into the property on XX/XX/2018. 

However, I trusted him I can still move into the property though it is inconvenient to me. In addition, my parents is visiting me from XXXX and we planned to be on vacations during holidays. 

After that, he kept on telling me everything is on track and we would be close on time until XX/XX/XXXX, he disappeared. He responded the next day and told me the bank wouldnt close the loan and the bank would not be responsible for any expense of hotel. He kept on lying to me he could cancel the loan or the loan would be close on this date and that date. 

Because his dereliction of duty, I have to pay {$120.00} a day to live in hotel for a total of {$960.00}. 

The delay ruined my entire holiday plan. I canceled the trips to south California because the loan wouldnt be closed. I would not go with PNC if they have told me the timeline in the first place. I think the whole practice is against UDAAP. 

Besides, XXXX promised to provide the project review copy but he did not. He again lied to me.",,PNC Bank N.A.,CA,945XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3113905

'' Well, this was interrupted, and so, therefore, they need to remove this delinquency ( just as stated by her own words ). Why hasn't she?

This change was not of my request or doing, and the interruption to ongoing payments not getting processed is an internal issue that I can not resolve for them. As a result, this posted delinquency to my credit file is long overdue to be removed and never should have been posted to my credit and all bureaus in the first place. The bureaus have also been contacted and I will continue to escalate this right to the point of legal action if necessary until the corrections to their mistakes have been updated and removed from all of my credit bureau reports, and my credit is once again restored as it should have been previously, prior to this misrepresented and inaccurate information that was reported.

So I logged in and in order to read all of the pertinent information, I had to opt in two or three different companies to be able to contact me at any time. If I did not want to do this on the computer that way, at the bottom was a number to call and do it over the phone. I was not clear about a 2.9 % charge, so I called to make sure I had a better understanding. I called the first time and spoke with customer service to explain the charge. I was told 0 % for 12 Months and a 2.9 % charge for any additional purchases made on the account. I said ok thank you. I called the second time and asked the same question and was told 0 % for 12 Months and a 2.9 % charge for any additional purchases made on the card. I did the balance transfer on XX/XX/2019 and it posted on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$3700.00}. It was a 4 % Balance Transfer Fee of 4 % which in total is {$150.00}. On XX/XX/2019 I made a small payment of {$33.00} and my balance was {$3800.00}. On XX/XX/2019 around XXXX I noticed my balance changed to {$3900.00}. I checked online and it stated, "" Interest Charge on Purchases {$3.00}. '' I didn't make any purchases, So I immediately called WellsFargo to see what happened and was told because I did the balance transfer in the middle of the month. I stated, "" What difference does it make if the promotion was over XX/XX/2019. '' He kept putting me on hold and could not give me an answer. he put in a complaint and gave me a complaint number and stated that a Case Manager of some sort would call me back in a day. A day went by no call so I called them. Let 's just say I called six different times, I have two complaints filed with numbers. The people I was transferred to where very rude and not knowledgeable about anything that I was asking. According to WellsFargo all the calls are recorded. So the last person I spoke with by the name of XXXX stated that the Case Managers were out. I said well when will I receive a phone call back and he stated, I don't know their schedules and being very rude. He also stated the case manager was out sick and my case was assigned that day. So on my part the calls started on XX/XX/2019. After going back and forth and nobody has called me back regarding my issue six different times and it is XX/XX/2019. WellsFargo in my opinion is practicing unethical business practices and I will not forget what happened last year with them stealing customers information and making accounts without their knowledge to get bonuses. They are misleading in their promotions with unethical, deceptive practices. I deserve answers!!!! All the calls are recorded, so Pull the calls WellsFargo and hear the proof of your unprofessional staff, customer service, me the customer asking to explain the 2.9 % charge and both customer service representatives stating 0 $ for 12 months and 2.9 % for any additional purchases. Also, I asked every call how the 2.9 % would be charged ; daily, monthly, annually and no answers. No managers are ever around, case managers are always out and nobody has called me back to rectify this situation.

During this time I was living at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX. However, my mailing address is my Mother 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX. I never received the hospital bill, and did not know what the insurance didn't pay until my credit was affected. Once I realized I had a balance at the hospital I paid it off in full to the hospital. The debt collection company XXXX was the debt collection agency in which was responsible for sending a notice of payment to the credit bureaus, in which I had been promised would be a paid and deletion letter. Where I am at fault is I never wrote down the name of the woman that gave me this promise.The account was updated to being paid on my credit report, however it was not deleted of my report as promised. I have been in contact with the company XXXX about this issue and I am not receiving a solution. Now the company is telling me "" deleting accounts is against their company policy '' which conflict with the original promise of deletion. I spoke with a representative today that stated "" We only delete accounts when it is our fault, and it is not our fault you didn't pay your bill. '' As rude and unnecessary as that comment was it holds some insight on the fact that the company does do deletions. I then spoke with a supervisor to try to get a better handle on the situation. I told supervisor XXXX that I was told the collection would be taken off of my credit and regardless of company policy, if people are being told that accounts are going to be taken off of their credit report and then it be false information that's negligence on the company 's part. XXXX then told me "" We have offices all over the United States, and different departments "" and therefore insinuating that because I do not know the name of the person I spoke to I do not have proof. I feel that this company needs to be investigated because if I received deceptive information to get me to pay a debt then I am sure there are others. I feel wronged that I paid almost XXXX dollars to get this account off my credit report and it is still on there. I am trying to buy a house for my family and this is preventing me from doing so. I went from having a XXXX to a XXXX credit score. It is the ONLY thing preventing me from purchasing a house. I feel so helpless in this situation and I am hoping something can be done not only for me, but others that have been lied to by this awful company.

Someone is there because it is dated today. I just moved into this town. That may have been a mistake and I believe someone is intentionally trying to ruin my credit.

It needs to be removed and blocked and the company is not taking calls on the issue. Someone was there to help me because it literally just posted today. 

My guess is that this company collects for the community I moved into last month. The collection agency is in the same town as my community. The community manager is not aware that I saw that my apartment went onto the market after I failed to pay my rent on XX/XX/2019. I paid it on the XXXX having utilized the grace period. They took the apartment off the market on XXXX after discovering that I paid the rent the day before. I have no idea if the community manager was spawned by the XXXX and a lying XXXX at the time, but she did all she could to hold me up from getting into this apartment. They recently left a card on my door with their core values which included serving the TEAM first. Shouldn't they be serving residents?? This was a personal message that they will back one another at all costs. Other residents have encouraged me telling that she will always do what she has to to feel like I am beneath her. It was the nicest way of calling her XXXX without saying the word I guess. I've seen so much come out of her that I can't put it passed her to get a head start on sending me to their debt collection agency prematurely sure of herself that I was not going to have my rent for XXXX on time.

My complaint is ... why should my score go down because you use some of the available credit you have? My utilization went from 1 % to 15 % of available credit. This practice of Credit Reporting companies is unfair and fraudulent, they drop your score and have not waited to see if you make your payments on time or even if you make the minimum or greater payment. What they are doing penalizes you for using your available credit WHICH is then used as a reason for lenders to charge you high interest rates. This practice is more of a collusion between Credit Reporting companies and Lenders. It really is as though you take one step forward and end up two steps backwards. It literally is putting the cart before the horse. 
I have worked very diligently to get a high credit score in order to get the advantages of it. Instead of helping consumers they are suppressing consumers and working with the Lenders to keep the you continually paying higher interest rates.

2019-01-15,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"I have had these two credit cards for many years, but between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX,  besides my own medical and dental bills, I was taking care of my elderly mom and got my two Mastercard credit cards with Capital One maxed out. Approximately a year ago I requested that Capital One please freeze my accounts, stop all interest, and let me continue to pay on the principal balance. They would not agree to that. I also offered a {$12000.00} payoff v. the balance of approximately {$16000.00}, and they would not agree to that either. 

I was on a plan for lesser payments, but ultimately they kept requiring me to catch payments up, including late fees assessed for not making full payments, and of course interest. The amount of interest being charged monthly is more than the payments I was making. I tried to settle with them, but nothing has worked. I can not afford an attorney for bankruptcy at this time, and their payment requirements are now beyond reach. 

I was going to utilize another credit card for a no interest period, but my credit has been destroyed and my other card now has only {$1000.00} available, not the {$12000.00} I had available when this started with my trying to settle with them over the last year or more. 

I have now paid so much interest that I have more than likely paid at least half of what would have been the original balance. I would like to see if you can help in any way. I think Capital One should have let me pay on the principal balance and stopped any interest from accruing. 

According to our Constitution, interest is not legal, and maybe some day that can be enforced again, but I would ask at minimum that they reduce the balance due by removing all interest they have charged me, at least for the last year or so that I have been trying to work with them, and also late payment fees while I was making the lesser payments they agreed to.. 

They told me it would save my credit report if I made the lesser payments under their plan but obviously that has not been the case. 

I finally stopped making payments because, as I said, the interest continued to be more than any payment I would make. Since discovering MasterCard is also providing funds for the invasion of illegal immigrants into our country by providing them with prepaid debit cards, it is my feeling that they should release all debt and clear my credit report.

Made all Payments on time.In early XX/XX/XXXX, My car was stolen and then recovered. It was a total loss, I continued making payments though out this process. The payoff check from the insurance was processed XXXX XXXX. Which left a balance of XXXX on the acc. 
After this I heard nothing from BOA and could access the current Balance on my Online mobile banking. So XXXX 's Payment went though, XXXX 's payment went though, and XXXX 's payment went through. My Payment Date for this loan is XXXX of each month. So then on XXXX XXXX I get a notification that a Charge off was placed on my Credit files with all Three Bureaus from BOA. Stating that {$210.00} was charged off??? and isn't due till XXXX XXXX which would be my last payment. This is crazy I Made all Payments. 
I Spoke with XXXX XXXX and she was not helpful, and for a week I got no repose. Then they fabricated a whole Story about how i was suppose to Pay off that Balance of {$850.00} with in 60days, then they said i had no GAP which I do.. when I said had "" no notice '' of this arbitrary 60 policy, she stated they wouldn't remove it. Even though they were auto-debting the acc every month. Bank Of america is blatantly trying to save face and not fixing this false Charge off. I am inclosing a full payment history which shows on time payments. I had to get a print out from the a bank Employee because they where told not to give to it to me, But Lucky there own employee saw how wrong they where treating me and printed it off for me anyway.The cover up of this false Charge OFF is sicking!! ACC of this loan as it was deleted off my online Banking for this reason. But i have the evidence. My Previous Credit Score Was XXXX This Damaged my Score over 75 points. All of this for no reason!! And they refuse to fix it. 
And also the XXXX XXXX Lady had the audacity to try and collect the {$210.00} that never should of been charged off in the first and still not fix the charge off on my credit!!!! I will Pursue legal Action If this isn't fixed. And to think all these idiots had to do was wait till the auto-debt on the XXXX of XXXX the payment would be done!!! even on the credit report the BOA states Charge Off Never Late How smart is that?

A salesman named XXXX XXXX from XXXX informed me that nothing was wrong with the vehicle when I test drove it. He was not honest with me as months later I later discovered that the vehicle instrument cluster was defective. 
The vehicle was transferred down to Miami and a salesman named XXXX XXXX collected my down payment and again assured me that the vehicle had no problems or issues. The XXXX report he provided me did not show the instrument cluster repair. I decided to purchase the car. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I was a victim of financial fraud of {$1000.00} by a lady named XXXX XXXX from PA XXXX case XXXX, XXXX PA XXXX and couldn't afford to make payment then. I informed Santander of this. I made XXXX more payment in late XXXX and in XXXX, Santander gave me a XXXX month extension due to financial hardship and a loss of a family member. In XXXX, I also cancelled the XXXX warranty of {$2800.00} and was refunded this amount by XXXX back to Santander. Since then, I have not made any payments because I discovered that the vehicle instrument cluster was replaced 5 years ago. I complained about this to both XXXX and Santander and neither business tried to resolve the issue. I was also struggling to get permanent employment and I was concerned about the high interest rate of 26 %. I asked for Santander to lower the rate and my request was denied. Without an explanation of the 26 % rate, Santander has forced me to accept that the rate is reasonable for my credit and income level. 
In addition : - Santander never justified the reason for my 26 % rate, the highest in the country - Santander never applied ANY portion of any of my payments ( {$4500.00} total ) towards interest or principal. 
- Santander varied the final payout balance numerous times from {$17000.00} to {$19000.00} to {$16000.00} to {$18000.00} in only a 7 month period. 
- Santander never showed on my account page how much interest is being accrued daily, weekly, or monthly and how much has been paid. 
- Neither Santander nor XXXX offered to replace my car with its defective instrument cluster for a different vehicle. 
- Numerous complaints filed against XXXX by me regarding the defective instrument cluster were ignored by the BBB. 
- I posted a complaint on XXXX against XXXX regarding the replaced instrument cluster and the complaint was removed by XXXX in XXXX. 

Santander promised me that they'll give me until Friday, XX/XX/XXXX to make a payment and they will not repo the vehicle. I told them that I will make payment that day because that's when I'll receive my first paycheck from my new job. Santander agreed and gave me the extension. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, my vehicle was picked up from a parking lot while I was siting inside a XXXX. Santander completely disregarded our prior agreement and repossessed the vehicle, leaving me stranded in XXXX, Fl, more than XXXX miles from my home without a way for me to get back to work. After calling the police on XX/XX/XXXX who notified me that the vehicle was indeed a repo, I was stuck at the XXXX after hours sitting at a table outside with my wallet and other personal property inside the car. I did not know anyone in the area and I had to walk to a nearby XXXX to spend the night there. I called Santander again on Monday, XXXX XXXX requesting to return the vehicle to me due to the fact they violated our agreement and the refused, instead demanding I cough up {$2700.00}.",,Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.,FL,331XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-01,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3166723

I have opened an account by Wells Fargo, and I am very unhappy. Please see below for the issues that I am having with them : When I applied for a business secured credit card, I was told that it has an automatic system that will upgrade to a unsecured credit card after 6 months, by making a review on my account. I have my secured credit card for almost a year, and I was never upgraded. In the meantime I was approved for a other business credit card. When I was researching how there policy works I found on XXXX XXXX that almost no-one was upgraded from a secured to an unsecured credit card. I know that I have a good score, I was approved for several unsecured credit cards without any issues, and I pay my bills in time, therefore I cant see any reason why I shouldn't get my unsecured credit card by Wells Fargo. The only reason why I didn't get upgraded to an unsecured credit card is because this whole thing is a scam, it doesn't begin to be true. 

My wife by mistake made a purchase by XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I did not give permission, or even know about the purchase. XXXX XXXX XXXX does not have a return policy, so I went and disputed the charge by Wells Fargo, since I know that they are supposedly responsible for any charge that was done without any permission from the card holder, part of their policy is : "" I have zero liability protection= that you are not responsible for any unauthorized transaction when you report them promptly ''. After a month of going back and forth with them with no customer service at all, they sent me a letter that it was declined, since the merchant showed that I did not follow the merchant cancellation policy, and I received the tickets. Yes i did receive the tickets, but it was never used since we couldn't even get any use out of those tickets, because it was ordered in error. I called them again and they told me that the only thing they can do is that I need to fill out a letter for declaration of claimant for fraud, but this was a purchase made in error, and it was a miss understanding, so claiming a letter about fraud won't help me because this wasn't a fraudulent charge. 

When I reviewed all the complaints on CFBP I saw that most complaints are on Wells Fargo, and there is a reason for that. They abuse, lie, and fool their customers in a way that all we can do is surrender. I am asking you to please look out, and see how many people are complaining about this bank. You are the only ones that can help us at this point.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,112XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3317581

2019-03-10,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","I got a loan over 1 1/2 years ago. The loan was immediately bought by XXXX XXXX. At that time, I was not able to sell my other home and finally started leasing my previous home. The renters moved out before the end of the contract and left the home in a total mess. I was not able to get the home on the market until I had done some work on it. The home remained empty for 8 months before I could get it sold. Meanwhile, I was paying both mortgages along with electric and gas bills. I worked 2 jobs during that time to make sure I made the payments before the end of each month. The mortgage payments were made to Provident usually on the last week of the month but mostly on the last day of the month. Like I mentioned, I worked very hard to get both payments made before the end of each month. I was very concerned about my credit being affected. On 2 occasions, Provident reported my payment as late because it wasn't made by phone before the cut off time of XXXX XXXX. My other mortgage company had a cut of time of XXXX XXXX when I would call a payment in. They also accepted payments on XXXX and XXXX and credited the account on those days. This is not the case with Provident Funding. I had called their Customer Service at least 5 times during this period but they offered no options for me. As I said before, these payments to Provident were all made by phone on the last day of the month but still counted as late. This has greatly affected my credit rating with the 2 main reporting agencies. When I have called Provident, they connect me with Customer Service, I get the same answer that nothing can be done about the reported late payments. There are now a total of 3 late payments with no other late payments reported from other creditors. I had a good standing record with XXXX  XXXX XXXX prior to selling my previous home. Im asking Provident to please work with me as I am now aware of the cut off times for a payment. I worked very hard to pay all bills on time, even getting a second job. 
I was also told by the company who got me this loan that I would be able to set up a bi-weekly payment so the mortgage could be paid in 2 installments each month. When I called Provident, the customer service department told me they had no such service available.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,PROVIDENT FUNDING ASSOCIATES,OK,730XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3175180

I was instead automatically approved for an XXXX XXXX Visa Platinum plus card with a different annual fee and none of the benefits. Thinking this was a mistake, I applied again for the XXXX Visa Signature Card and the application went pending. I called BofA to see what was going on and they said they could approve me for the Visa Plat if i chose to. I chose not to but asked to have someone else look at my application for the Visa Signature card. He they asked if I consented to have my application reconsidered and i said yes. He then approved me for the other card, a Visa Platinum and claimed that I had never applied for the Visa Signature. I was escalated to a supervisor and she claimed my XXXX credit score and XXXX income did not qualify me for the Visa Signature and they decided to automatically approve me for a card that was not marketed at all on their application page. BAIT AND SWITCH. This is very deceptive. Definitely a UDAAP issue. I did some research online and there are HUNDREDS of other people who have complained about this same deceptive marketing practice. If you look at the link below, you will see advertising for ONLY the Visa Signature card and not the inferior yet still expensive Visa Platinum. There is no mention of the Platinum benefits or fees because they are inferior and nobody would apply knowing that they could be approved for the inferior card. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I never wanted the XXXX XXXX Visa Platinum with a {$50.00} annual fee and sub-par benefits . Nor did I apply for it.

I made an additional payment for XX/XX/XXXX bringing my total potential eligible payments to 121. XXXX stated my eligible date of completion was XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted the Employer Certification Form and application for Public Service Loan Forgiveness as instructed by XXXX. I then received correspondence stating my application was rejected based on lack of qualifying payments. I began calling XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX about this issue. XXXX stated I lacked 5/6 qualifying payments. I reviewed my online account and it reflected 5/6 payments remaining. This was the same account that presently showed XXXX  before I sent my application in. I later checked the account again after seeking help from calling representatives with XXXX. My account now showed I had 57/63 remaining payments. I attempted to call on a weekly basis from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and was told the same thing numerous times. I was advised my account was under review and I would received an answer within 3/5 business days. I would call back after that time passed and was advised the review would take 6 months to a year. I was advised my several representatives and managers at XXXX that my payments could be seen as being paid on my account for the months of XXXX XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised these were the payments not being county as qualifying but my Employer Certification Form was approved and my payments are electronically debited for the amount I was instructed to pay. I was advised by XXXX that it was a computer glitch and I would have to request a payment review ( which I was advised that was happening when XXXX was 1st made away in XX/XX/XXXX ) and it would potentially take a year to review the remaining 5/6 payments. I am at a standstill with XXXX and I have provided everything they need but I keep getting a runaround and I feel I am being treated unfairly because I am trying to apply for loan forgiveness. I also was advised by XXXX that my application is on file and that I would not have to re-submit a new application. I do not feel this is accurate information because I am beginning not to trust anything that XXXX recommends because of the lack of effort and misinformation that I have received. I have attached the prior complaint and recent correspondence from XXXX. The newest correspondence shows that my payments were not counted from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, these are the payments that I was informed that should quality and put my account over or at 120 qualifying payments.",,AES/PHEAA,GA,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3164248

Early XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alert from XXXX XXXX informing me that my credit score had dropped by 11 points. 

I immediately purchased membership to Experian ( $ XXXX/mo ), XXXX ( $ XXXX/mo ) and XXXX  ( $ XXXX/mo ) in order to investigate and dispute the matter. 

I found that XXXX XXXX XXXX also known as XXXX XXXX ( account # XXXX ) had reported payment status to all three credit bureaus which caused my credit score to plunge. 

I filed a dispute with all three credit bureaus. The results came back the same, XXXX XXXX XXXX also known as XXXX XXXX ( account # XXXX ) confirmed that this account was part of the bankruptcy and that they should not be reporting on this account. 

However, to date ( XX/XX/XXXX ), my credit score still has not  recovered. XXXX at the time XXXX/XXXX reported in XX/XX/XXXX, my score was XXXX. Today it is currently XXXX. Experian at the time XXXX/XXXX  reported in XX/XX/XXXX, my score was XXXX. Today it is currently XXXX. XXXX at the time XXXX/XXXX  reported in XX/XX/XXXX, my score was XXXX. Today it is currently XXXX. 

Today, as I prepared my evidence to upload, I noticed that the last date that XXXX/XXXX reported to XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX/XXXX is still reporting and ruining my life.

2019-07-15,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Can't stop withdrawals from your account,"I deposited a check on XX/XX/19 in the amount of {$4900.00} and it cleared without issue. The bank can not reverse it at all. By law the checks take 2-3 days to clear. But on XX/XX/19 my account was in overdraft by that amount. My bank uncleared the check for no reason and without warning. I filed a complaint, tried to follow up with the bank, and the sender, and got no real answer. I have proof of the check clearing on XXXX in my statements, so I do not understand why this is happening to me. 

In a response from Wells Fargo they basically say nothing. Why did they clear the funds? And more importantly, once the check cleared it was my money and they can not confiscate this money without due process ( i.e., a court order ). Just saying the other bank asked for the money means nothing and it is my right to sue them for this. They are taking my money away without due course and I will be seeking legal remedy. 

Furthermore, I demand my money back. An explanation of what happened and why is not sufficient after this gross injustice. The whole point of having a bank account is knowing that my money is safe, not to wake up one day with an insufficient funds notice because one or more banks decided to unclear a check after three months. 

Additionally, on XX/XX/19 I was told by a customer service rep ( XXXX ) over the phone that the check would be returned to me because I hadn't endorsed it. I thought it was illegal to clear and unclear checks like this. They can not take away the money that belongs to me after funds are credited to my account- at that point that is my possession ). 

To conclude, Wells Fargo describing this happened does not clear the issue. They took my money away based on a no reason given issuer bank demand - that is ( at least to me ) a violation of Federal clearing laws - all check clearing related matters are governed by Regulation CC which prescribes the rules for this under the law : under Expeditious return of checks. ( which gives 2 business days to return a check ) and Notice of nonpayment ( which also asks for two days limit for such notice that notice can be via returned check, a writing ( including a copy of the check ), or telephone.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NJ,089XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3306169

XXXX Claims that they are servicing the debt for Bank of America ( B of A ) since XXXX. However, the servicing agreement between B of A and XXXX was executed on XXXX. Regardless, both B of A and XXXX claim to be collecting on the alleged debt owed. I have contacted both XXXX and B of A on numerous occasions and advised that I was never sued separately on the alleged deficiency balance due. The New Jersey law listed below was explained to both XXXX and B of A. It was ignored by both parties. The New Jersey law listed below clearly states a separate lawsuit must be filed in relation to the deficiency balance to be valid. 

Deficiency judgments are allowed in New Jersey, but not in the foreclosure action itself. To obtain a deficiency judgment, the lender must file a separate lawsuit within three months after the foreclosure sale or, if confirmation of the sale is required, from the date of the confirmation of the sale. ( N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:50-1 through 2A:50-2.1. ) The court may limit the amount of the deficiency judgment if the borrower disputes it. The borrower may dispute the amount of the deficiency by answering the lenders suit and introducing evidence regarding the propertys fair market value. The court will then limit the deficiency judgment amount to the difference between the debt and the fair market value as of the date of the foreclosure sale. ( N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:50-3. ) Neither XXXX nor B of A filed a separate lawsuit to bring the alleged debt to a valid status per NJ State law. This alleged should have been extinguished 3 months after the foreclosure sale date took place. However, both XXXX and B of A, have proceeded with aggressive collection activity and have reported the debt to my credit bureau report.

I initially fell behind on payments ever since I moved to my new address. This was my responsibility and my fault here for not following up. 

In XXXX, I called the Wells Fargo Dealer Service multiple times in an attempt to pay off the debt. A settlement bill was scheduled to be sent a total of three times. The first did not arrive, the second arrived however it was burnt from our house fire. A third was send on the date extension XX/XX/18, with the due date XX/XX/18. The bill arrived afterwards, however an extension was not given. 
We attempted to pay at a local Wells Fargo to no avail. Email was unavailable to pay the bill. There is now a charge-off negative remark on my credit report. 

I would like to address this by paying the debt by the original {$290.00} payments on the Wells Fargo Dealer Services payment portal or get the negative remark removed from my credit report.

2019-07-08,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","SUBJECT : RETURN OF FUNDS FROM DOUBLE MORTAGE PAYMENT IN MONTH OF XXXX On or about XXXX XX/XX/2019 I authorized a monthly ACH draft from my XXXX XXXX checking account for the purpose of paying my mortgage to Freedom Mortgage. By XXXX XX/XX/2019 I had not received any form of written communication from Freedom Mortgage that verified the ACH draft would take effect. Therefore, on XXXX XX/XX/2019 I paid my mortgage payment via my on-line banking with XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XX/XX/2019 I finally received a letter ( dated XXXX XX/XX/2019 ) from Freedom Mortgage that stated my ACH draft request had been processed and that my XXXX checking would be debited on XXXX XX/XX/2019. I immediately called Freedom Mortgage and was told that it was impossible to stop the ACH draft on that day, and that I should attempt to stop the payment of the draft by my bank ( XXXX XXXX ). I called XXXX and asked that the draft not be honored. XXXX XXXX took all the pertinent information but stated that if the draft had already executed, it could not be stopped. And it was not stopped. 

Therefore, it is clear that I made two XXXX mortgage payments to my loan with Freedom Mortgage ; one was in error. I need one of those payments returned to my XXXX XXXX checking account. Both I and my wife are retirees and live on a very fixed income and budget. The {$2200.00} that made the second XXXX mortgage payment are the funds needed for our living expenses and other bills for the entire month of XXXX. 

After speaking to a Freedom Mortgage representative by phone on Friday, XXXX XX/XX/2019, I faxed to Freedom Mortgage the information above and a copy of my XXXX XXXX checking account information showing both payments had posted ( been paid ) to Freedom Mortgage. The Freedom Mortgage representative had provided me their fax # XXXX, which I used. On Monday, XXXX XX/XX/2019, I called Freedom Mortgage Customer Service # XXXX to inquire as to the status of my request for return of one of the two XXXX payments I made. I spoke with XXXX, id # XXXX, in XXXX, Indiana. I was first told that once the request had "" been processed '', a check would be sent to me. I asked why an electronic transfer could not be made directly to my checking account. I was put on hold for several minutes. I was then told that "" XXXX '' had told XXXX that once my fax "" had been found '', she would have an electronic transfer made to my XXXX XXXX Checking account, and that would take 5-7 days. I expressed my disbelief that an electronic transfer takes 5-7 days, and asked to speak with XXXX 's supervisor. I was again put on hold for several more minutes. I was then told a supervisor was not available I requested to make an appointment with a supervisor and that request was denied. The supervisor in question is "" XXXX '', also in XXXX, Indiana. In the final analysis, I received no confirmation that my fax had been located, nor that I would receive my funds any time soon.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Freedom Mortgage Company,VA,22191,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,2019-07-08,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3298610

Charge reposted by Discover to my card apparently on XX/XX/18, I notice and message on XX/XX/18 requesting details. Apparently charge was upheld by vendor, so I assume the complete details not passed on to vendor. On XX/XX/18, Discover replies and informs me vendor upheld, but they will continue dispute. Repost of provisional credit was once again not applied until XX/XX/18. Apparently vendor upheld a second time ( despite vendor themselves investigating and admitting equipment malfunctioned and their accounting dept tells me to dispute the charge ) at which point Discover reposts twice on XX/XX/18, and they state it's because my credit card number changed mid-dispute. I explain they already reposted to the old card on XX/XX/18, and I can clearly see four debits and two credits on my account, resulting in me paying for the vendor 's charge and also paying Discover for it as well. Dispute escalation manager replied and indicated I must be confused because some were on my old card number and some on my new. I message a couple times to explain she is not accounting for all transactions in her summary of debits and credits, and they repeatedly argued, even though there is clear evidence in my transaction history. It is poor customer service to take weeks to reply to messages when it's stated at the bottom of the screen the customer can expect a reply within 24 hours. But it's absolutely inexcusable for the disputes department to manually adjust an account and not take seriously a customer 's complaint despite evidence to the contrary. They eventually credited back twice, which resulted in eight total debits and credits. They never explained why they credited twice, if the vendor eventually validated my dispute or if Discover credited due to my complaint. However, my balance does not reflect that as it should be a net XXXX. Once the credits were posted on XX/XX/18, it should have resulted in a wash.

I then personally contacted the Collection Agency XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   and asked for valid verification that this debt was mine. I knew I didnt miss a payment to the power company, for obvious reasons they are always the first bill I pay. All I received from the Collection Agency were term dates of XXXX XXXX spanning back from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and the alleged charges they claimed I owed {$170.00}. They had nothing to show me that could verify I owe anything. After a bit of research, it was determined that this does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation. This inaccurate, incomplete document contains no accounting of any payments made nor missed, nor the dates on which those payments were made or missed. There isnt even any documentation with my signature on it that proves this is even my account at all. This information could have easily been drawn up and sent by anyone or simply created in human error. Their verification document in no way provides sufficient verification of this alleged debt. There isnt any legitimate, verifiable proof that I owe anything to their Company, because I dont. 

This collection on my credit reports are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ XXXX. You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} FCRA violation fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. 

I intend to follow through with the suit if this is not deleted from my account within 15 days.

If Experian can prove that I never had automatic payment or that I canceled it or block it or my bank canceled it or block then the collection account that alleged {$1300.00} should remain and if they can not which is a fact then Experian must deleted the only negative information or the collection about the XXXX alleged owed amount of $ XXXX.because my bank write a letter and confirmed that I never called my bank to cancel that automatic and I never canceled that automoatic payment and my account that provide funds to that automatic payment is same and open and has always funds of over 4000 $ daily and if XXXX wanted to get paid for any amount they have the ability to do so and they must stop harrassing me and damaging my financial reputation.

2019-05-23,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with fraud alerts or security freezes,,"Back in 2017 after the large security breach, I placed a security freeze through each of the 3 credit reporting companies - XXXX, XXXX, & Equifax. This was a long, tedious process but it was finally accomplished. With XXXX I had no trouble lifting the freeze. However, I am finding that trying to unfreeze the accounts through XXXX and Equifax has been not only hard but nearly impossible. I was given pin # s to use by XXXX and XXXX but NOT by Equifax when I was ready to lift the freeze. 

I have tried repeatedly to have my security freeze permanently removed from XXXX, using the pin # they sent me but it keeps giving me a security freeze error and then recommends that I call them at XXXX. This automated system does not give you the option of removing a freeze, only of placing a freeze or fraud alert and there is no capability of talking to a live person. I have also tried their site at experian.com/upload but keep getting the message that the documents are not loading. Although sending my information online has it's risks, I feel like sending all of my information through the mail feels like an even riskier option. 

As for Equifax, I do not know how to proceed since I can not find any paperwork they sent to me with a pin #, like the other two did. 

I would greatly appreciate your help with this problem.

The job was financial related and required a good credit report. Two weeks later I was denied housing because the company stated my credit report showed debt to another housing provider. I pulled my Equifax credit report and discovered an inordinate amount of errors. There were over 50 errors total on my report. I sent them a letter immediately explaining and showing in detail why each item was an error and asked them to investigate and resolve. In XXXX they sent me back a letter saying that they had completed an investigation and verified all information. It was a very blanket letter not outlining how they conducted any investigation. I then sent them a response showing that these were in fact errors and should be either updated or deleted ( based upon each individual line item 's situation ). The response I received was almost an identical letter to the first one they sent. It did not address any of the my concerns at all. Overall I have repeatedly contacted this company in hopes that they would resolve these errors and they have not. Ive sent letters in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX immediately upon receiving their repossess and have receipts of certified my mail being received by them each time. To date I am still unable to secure housing or a suitable job because of these errors. I. work in finance and can not afford to have such errors on my report. In addition to all of the negative errors I also discovered thatchy are not reporting at all on many of my positive credit lines. I have contacted my credit card companies to confirm that they report to the bureaus nd each confirmed that indeed they do report. Therefore there is no sufficient reason why my positive credit lines are not reported and thus why all of these erroneous negative items are reported. I am in a world of trouble because of this negligence and they just keep sending back the same letter saying they verified the items. There is no way to verify something that never happened. When I asked for proof of these items belonging to me in the form of anything I authorized or signed or even recordings where I gave approval I received nothing repeatedly. Please help me.

2019-07-16,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"",Originally my loan was with XXXX. I lost my job and asked for a loan modification. I went to consumer credit counseling for help. XXXX had so many modification applications at the time they had outsourced some of their work. Anyway they mislabeled my loan lost my loan application and this continued for a couple of years. Instead of a modification they started foreclosure proceedings. I ended up filing bankruptcy. My mortgage was included. Then after a few years of paying my bankruptcy payments XXXX wanted the amount increased. I was paying XXXX a month they wanted XXXX a month I could not pay that amount so my case was dismissed. I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX to get this done. We called several times a month before the bankruptcy and after the bankruptcy was dismissed. They finally came back with XXXX left on my principal balance and were supposed to be doing a modification. In the meantime I received a letter from Shellpoint mortgage saying they were servicing my loan and it was XXXX. We called XXXX and they told us that my loan had not been sold or transferred and that they were still working on a modification. Well it had been sold and Shellpoint had started foreclosure proceedings. I called them and told them what happened and I contacted my attorney to file bankruptcy again. But they stopped the foreclosure and agreed to do a modification. I did the trial period and the paperwork came back with my principal balance being XXXX. I disputed the amount of my principal balance. They told me if I didnt sign the modification that I would immediately go into foreclosure. I said I would sign the paperwork to avoid foreclosure but I disputed the charges. I contacted the Alabama attorney generals office for help. Shellpoint told them that the charges were from the missed payments from when XXXX had my loan. I explained to Shellpoint that XXXX agreed that all I owed was XXXX and they were supposed to do the modification which Shellpoint was fully aware of anyway. My first paper statement from Shellpoint reflects my principal balance being XXXX. They still refuse to remove the charges of over XXXX making what I owe more than my original loan and have sold my mortgage to XXXX mortgage servicing. Also when I called Shellpoint to tell them that making the payments on the first of the month might be a problem their agent told me that Shellpoint doesnt consider a payment late if its made in the month its due. They sent me a nasty letter threatening foreclosure even though I was never behind and added late payment fees to every payment. But that didnt happen until I sent them messages requesting the other fraudulent charges be removed.,Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",AL,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-16,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3308494

I filed the dispute originally only days after the initial charge and again a few months after the initial charge, well within the legally allowed timeframe. Yet on XX/XX/XXXX Chase sent me a letter stating the allowed timeframe to file the dispute had passed and they considered the charge valid.

Be advised that there are no regulations promulgated by the DOE and the FCRA that restrict you from updating/correcting past payment history. By failing to update previously reported information, you are in violation of Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA. Be advised that the Holder Rule protects consumers claims & defenses against a creditor or assignee 16 C.F.R. 433.

The advisory opinion goes on to state that the Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA addresses the duty to correct and update information by furnishers, or persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRA ) such as credit bureaus. In particular, this section requires a person that has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide any information needed to make it complete and accurate. Thus, on its face, this provision requires a furnisher to provide corrected or updated information to the consumer reporting agency that it had reported to originally. This duty extends to student loan accounts reported to CRAs, regardless of whether they were accurate at one point, because the section requires the furnisher both to update accounts as well as to correct even if the loan was correctly reported as delinquent, but has subsequently been paid.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",GA,,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3108091

The agent was very helpful and took the hard inquiry disputes without a problem. Today, less than 24 hours later, I am attempting to dispute the SAME hard inquiries listed on my account. I have spoken to 3 different representatives, supposedly 1 was a supervisor, and NONE of them will accept my dispute. All 3 agents claimed they were unable to dispute the information. I asked them if the policy has changed within the last 24 hours and I was told no. Each agent claims that hard inquiries are not disputable. I asked the agent to pull the dispute number provided to my wife so that they could verify that the information is the exact same accounts and can in fact be disputed. She pulled the file and still said these accounts are not disputable. I asked her for the name of the agent who handled my wife 's file. I was told they could not give me that information, even though the information has nothing to do with my wife 's file and is just the agent 's name. I then informed her that I would be filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Better Business Bureau. I asked the agent to please connect me to the same agent that handled my wife 's case. The agent told me she was transferring my call but not to that agent.

2018-12-30,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","On XX/XX/XXXX I tried to make a payment on my mortgage. My mortgage was previously serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Carrington Mortgage services is now the servicer. The terms in which my payments are processed have changed dramatically. I have to pay fees to make payments which I did not have to do before, my payments have gone up again which did not happen before, and then if I fall behind which in my almost 10 years of paying on my mortgage has happened, life happens. When I try to make my payments Carrington shuts down avenues to make them. If I am in the 30 day late category they refuse online payments and refuse over the phone payments. I spoke at length with two representatives from Carrington Mortgage Services on XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised that they will take my payment from through XXXX XXXX at an additional {$8.00} charge because they were refusing my online payment and would apply it by the end of business. I made XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX XXXX I paid more than enough to cover the late fees. That brings me less than 30 days past due. I was assured they would apply the payment and that they process payments on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX as well. Either way my payment was made before 3pm that Friday. I checked my Carrington online account and it is still not posted. This is not the first time Carrington had refused payments. I was only 1 month behind and I pay my penalty. You have people who serve their time in prison for crimes. I had an issue that arose and paid my late fee. For them to continue to penalize me and refuse my payments or not apply my payments which is the case here I feel is unacceptable. As of writing this I am officially less than 30 days past due and should be cleared on any default on my loan. I am fine with a new servicer on my loan, however I am quite offended and frustrated that I feel Carrington is not servicing my loan in the same manner it was being serviced for the almost 10 years I have had my loan. I have not signed any paperwork or agreed to any additional fees and I feel they are playing deceptive games by refusing to apply payments to try to send my loan to foreclosure. My servicer should be the one per my understanding of the law to try to help with foreclosure avoidance and refusing to apply full monthly payments, especially when such payment brings my loan back into the less than 30 days past due status I feel is fraudulent activity and I am requesting they cease and desist these perceived fraudulent activities immediately and apply any and all payments to my account and fix any damages to my credit report. I am also requesting that they go back and fix my credit for the last time they held almost 3 months of my payments in a suspense account and refused to release the payments and during that time reported negatively on my credit report.",,"CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC",CA,925XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3112850

On my XX/XX/XXXX statement, I was told to pay a partial payment of my usual monthly mortgage. My usual payment is {$1400.00} per month. My XXXX statement said to pay {$370.00}, as a {$1000.00} payment had already been applied. I paid {$400.00} for my XXXX statement. I soon received a letter informing me I did not pay my XXXX balance. By XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter saying I owed {$2500.00} because I didn't pay the whole balance due in XXXX. So I had to take a loan from my parents to cover this cost. I paid this total amount then on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called XXXX and asked about the discrepancy in the XXXX statement, they were not sure why the problem happened and they would get back to me. They did not. When I called back around XX/XX/XXXX, the service agents couldn't explain why there was a {$1000.00} payment made to my account, and later retracted. When this payment was retracted that caused my partial payment to not meet the monthly cost and I was sent a failure to pay notice. At this point XXXX told me it was going to be ok. But what happened to the {$1000.00} partial payment applied in XXXX? After I had already paid the {$2500.00} for XXXX, I called again to XXXX to understand what happened. They replied with "" we don't know ''. I called again today, XX/XX/XXXX to find out what they discovered happened to the missing {$1000.00} from my XXXX statement. They told me they didn't know, they also said they might have applied someone else 's payment to my mortgage. They were not sure of their own book keeping. I was charged a {$56.00} fee. My credit also took a hit, as I was considered delinquent for paying the amount XXXX billed me. XXXX 's poor book keeping caused me I injustice to my credit score, when I'm trying to finance a new car, and now my monthly payments might go up {$100.00} a month. XXXX  mortgage company made multiple mistakes, charged me a late fee, messed up my credit, and their resolution to their mistake is "" I apologize.

2019-02-02,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"After a payout from my divorce on XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from the Chase Branch in XXXX XXXX to tell me I qualified for as a Chase Private Client ( although at the time my balance was tens of thousands of dollars under the qualifying amount for this status ). I went to the bank and and they organised this change in status and switched all of my accounts over accordingly ( that included my going from an entry level checking account to an account which has no fees as long as there is a minimum high balance or other qualifying events associated with my accounts which this large deposit suddenly made me eligible for ). Several months later I decided to move most of my money to retirement investments and around six months after I qualified for the Private Client status, I received another phone call to tell me I was disqualified from Chase Private Client for not having a high enough balance in my Chase accounts. I had to return to the bank and have my accounts switched back to regular accounts becasue my low income and savings meant my minimum balances would generate fees. This was all taken care of by the person who was managing my Chase Private Client status. I have since had to purchase check books and so on for this account as anyone would with a regular account. Given my salary and savings, and after transferring my funds into my retirement, if I were to walk into the bank I would not qualify for this account. 

I did not realise, until today, that the bank for some reason did not change my checking account back to a regular entry level account when they took away the private client status and changed my savings account. I have been charged $ XXXX/month for my checking account becasue they funds have been under the minimum $ XXXX. I had no idea that they skipped changing my checking account when they changed my savings and happily took me out of their program ( for which I stopped receiving any benefits from back when I lost the status - i.e no free check books etc ). I called chase and they offered to refund 2 of the payments. I believe the bank should refund all of the payments of {$25.00} they have removed from my checking account since they made the error back in late XXXX. They said I should have read the fine print on every monthly statement becasue the conditions of my account are written in there. I was led to believe I had been switched back to my regular entry level account that I had before they changed it. 

I would like to initiate a claim for these {$25.00} payments. I believe the bank made a error and are are trying to mislead me into thinking it was my fault by trying to blame me using the "" read the fine print '' line.

I called XXXX and complained because this happened before and I filed a complaint on XX/XX/2018. It took weeks to get it fixed. I called XXXX today and they told me that the credit score that Credit Karma is showing for me is not their credit score for me. So, if that is true, Credit Karma is showing the wrong score and I fear they are doing so to get me to take out more credit cards. Also, I received a called from XXXX telling me a fraud was placed on my social security number and that I needed to call XXXX immediately. 

I am concerned because my mortgage loan is currently in the underwriting process and I am unable to know what is going on because of these current actions. Also, since underwriters check fraud records during their approval process, I fear that a scammer has gotten my information while that report was being run.

I have saved the emails, I have the bank statement and copy of the XX/XX/XXXX check, and the copy of the confirmation where I paid yesterday along with the paper bill with a 2 month balance owed.

This loan was initially and has always been serviced by XXXX XXXX. It was setup w/ a direct debit ( ACH ) from my savings account and for the first year or so was paid as agreed. In XX/XX/XXXX I sold a truck which had a $ XXXXpayment and in XX/XX/XXXX my wifes car w/ a $ XXXX/payment will be paid off. During XXXX we had some insufficient funds transactions that resulted in ACH missed payments. The relationship between Citizens and XXXX was always confused. There were times when I would return a call from Citizens & or XXXX to make a payment after a missed ACH and they would tell me the loan was current. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I called Citizens Bank/XXXX & spk w/ XXXX XXXX to make a payment and start the process of getting caught up. She advised me the account had charged off and I need to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX. I advised I was not comfortable dealing w/ a third-party debt collector and wish to pay Citizens bank directly she couldnt accept my payment. She stated the loan was charge off on XX/XX/XXXX by Citizens and that was early because the loan had not yet reach 120 days past due, and she suggested that we bring on XXXX. I agreed and she joined XXXX/XXXX ph # XXXX, who said the charge off was authorized by Citizens bank on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX officially sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that I needed to speak w/ them. I again expressed that I wasnt comfortable dealing w/ a third-party collection agency, but still XXXX couldnt help me. She did say another collections department at Citizens may be of assistance at XXXX. I then asked to speak w/ a manager at Citizens bank and XXXX brought on Manager XXXX , but he refused my payment, I asked for his supervisor and was told that person couldnt come to the phone, but they could have them call me w/ in 72 hours. I have received no return call as of XX/XX/XXXX. To all three individuals I expressed all of the above of about freeing up cash flow and I was prepared to bring this loan current in short order and honor the term of the original loan and that my loan be reinstated as only 7 days had passed since the charge, again XXXX refused my payment and told me I had to deal w/ XXXX XXXX XXXX ph # XXXX and that Citizens nor XXXX could assist me further. I then called XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the representative stated I needed to settle the $ XXXX balance w/ them and suggested that I settle for an immediate {$12000.00} payment. I advised I couldnt pay that and wouldnt be doing so soon, the representative chuckled and said well that might be your opinion. I advised I wanted to deal directly w/ Citizens bank and the representative hung up on me.

Citizen refused to help me and told me I need to deal w/ XXXX . I am ready to make payments to them immediately and bring my account current quickly ( I have advised them of this ). On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I called back Citizen bank again requesting to speak w/ a manager. I inquired about the 72-hour manager call back and they couldnt speak to that return call. I asked again for consideration on accepting my payments, but they again refused. I then requested a pay history since loan inception. They advised I needed to contact XXXX for the pay history online. I made the request with XXXX & have not received it. I am requesting Citizens bank reinstate my loan and I will catch up on pass due payments in the next 45days and ensure all future payments are made on time. I think Citizens being a very large institution can work w/ me here, especially since when I was advised of the action the XXXXhird party had only been engaged in the prior seven days and that over the course of the loan there were times I could have made payments after a missed ACH but was told by either Citizens or XXXX that I was not overdue and didnt need to make a payment.

I would email them and call with information they need, only to not be able to reach them at all and then deadlines expiring. Then I would hear from them only to inform me I had to start from the beginning. Starting from the beginning they would always enter some type of vital information incorrectly as well causing further missed deadlines. This predatory practice went on for months until I hired a law firm and this is when direct communication with Wells Fargo went smoothly. I then released the Law firm from working on the case, but I figured it would be fine because Wells Fargo was communicating with me directly at this point. This is when Wells Fargo stopped all contact with me again purposely to miss deadline to extend the timeline and gather more late fees.

Even with the sharp decline in property values in XXXX, in the intervening 10-year period the property has never appraised for more that {$350000.00} through at least 3 other independent appraisers. Consequently, we can not refinance the house through any alternative lender ( even through the VA ) since, after making payments for over 13 years, the outstanding balance is {$370000.00} and at an exorbitant interest rate of 6.875 %. We have contacted Wells Fargo two ( 2 ) times requesting a refinance ( combining both the {$300000.00} primary and {$71000.00} second into a single 15-year mortgage or simply refinancing the first at a lower rate ) but, they are unwilling to make any changes or amendments. We are of the belief that Wells Fargo artificially inflated the appraisal in XXXX and now, through interest rates that are double the current rate and due to a fraudulent appraisal, they are unwilling to provided us with any recourse or alternative due to their deceptive lending practices. Additionally, these practices and timelines are perfectly consistent with the issues surrounding a {$2.00} XXXX fine wherein Wells Fargo artificially inflated applicant 's incomes ( they must have inflated ours to qualify for the fraudulently inflated appraisal amount ) and XXXX XXXX fine from you and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( wherein Wells Fargo inflated the appraisal in order to collect additional fees based upon the higher property value ).

2019-02-18,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Confusing or missing disclosures,,"I've used PayPal Credit over the past couple of years to make purchases on XXXX based on offers of no interest credit I was offered on multiple purchases. I've borrowed and paid back several thousand dollars. This past XXXX I was offered a "" 24 month with no interest and equal monthly payments '' promotion provided I spent over {$600.00} which I took advantage of. I made purchases totaling {$2200.00} and was told I would have 24 equal payments of {$92.00}. Subsequent to that purchase I also agreed to use PayPal Credit to purchase items using their "" 6 months with no interest if paid in full '' which, about the same time I made the 24 month purchase, they started saying there would be a "" minimum payment '' with these 6 month promotions. Previously, those promotions would be "" 6 months no interest and no payments '' if paid in full - which I always have done. While I wasn't sure how they would calculate the minimum payments on the 6 month items I assumed whatever payments I would make would apply to the balances of those items and reduce the amount I needed to pay them off during the sixth month time period. After I got notice of the first month with a minimum payment that exceeded the {$92.00} on the 24 month promotion I made a payment in excess of that minimum simply so I could calculate how they allocated the different amounts - meaning, how much would go to each purchase as there were multiple purchases on the 6 month promotions. I was stunned to see that they applied nearly the entire amount of the payment - {$450.00} - to the 24 month items. I first emailed them and got a "" canned '' response stating that the payment would be applied to the 24 month item and if I wanted to "" re-allocate '' the payment, I could do so after the next statement billing cycle. While I thought that strange ( and, when I looked back, not all of the {$450.00} payment was applied to the 24 month items, but instead about {$390.00}. I was never able to figure out, looking at the statement, how they planned to allocate the payment ) I then called and had the payment re-allocated with the intention the minimum on the 24 month items would be paid first and the rest would go toward the first items due, which was in early XXXX. This happened the next month as well and I ended up calling and having the payment re-allocated ( I thought ) with the first part of the payment being the {$92.00} on the 24 month promotion. Looking back on the statements, I'm still very confused as to how they're allocating the payments ( and, I get a different explanation each time I call ) - but, at that time, when I called I made an additional payment while I had the representative on the phone. He told me simply to call in each month and they could allocate the money exactly as I wished - with any payment over the {$92.00} being allocated to the 6 month items as I requested. This month, on XX/XX/XXXX I had a minimum payment of {$260.00} due, so I called in and made a payment of {$1000.00} which would make the minimum payment on the 24 month promotion ( the {$92.00} ) plus pay off all of what was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I was assured by the representative that would be what happened. When I checked back a couple days later almost the entire payment amount had been applied to the 24 month promotion. So, I started a chain of "" messages '' ( emails? ) via PayPal 's website requesting they allocate the payment as I had requested. After three or four messages the allocation was changed to the entire "" minimum payment '' - including whatever was required because of the purchases using the 6 month promotions - being applied to the 24 month promotion and then the rest going to the XXXX items - leaving a balance of a bit over {$160.00} on the XXXX items. I then called in an attempt to get all the money I had intended go to the XXXX items applied as I had agreed with the PayPal representative who I originally scheduled the payment with over the phone. After feeling as if the person I was talking to didn't understand what my intentions were I requested to talk to a manager who then told me their rules require them to apply ALL of the "" minimum payment '' to the items with recurring monthly payments - the items I AGREED to terms which said I would have 24 EQUAL monthly payments of {$92.00}. The manager stated that until I had paid off the 24 month promotion this is how the initial part of any payment would be allocated - therefore, essentially, changing the terms of the agreement. Obviously, PayPal feels the FACT they offered me a promotion which called for the 24 months of EQUAL payments of {$92.00} was not anything resembling a contract or firm agreement. By my calculations, depending on how long it takes me to pay off the items I purchased using their 6 month promotion ( the last ones are due to paid off by XX/XX/XXXX ) I might have paid an additional ( almost ) {$1000.00} over the agreed amount of the payments on the 24 month promotion. Additionally, after going through this with the manager I looked more closely at how PayPal has been allocating the payments thus far, and it's hard to understand what they're doing. I don't believe they are allocating the payments in any way according to what I've been told or even according to what the manager explained to me. I do believe my total amount owed is correct, but their statements are not clear as to how these payments are being distributed. Additionally, I find NOTHING on the statement which would tell me how they were going to allocate the payments - meaning their decision to apply ALL of the minimum to the 24 month promotions seems arbitrary and certainly was nothing I agreed to or would have agreed to. I've made the purchases and I will pay off all these items, but I really object to them forcing me to pay the additional money each month in order to be able to pay off the items I purchased on the six month deals. I believe it is an attempt to make it more likely I will end up paying interest on some of the items because, as I said, I'm going to have to come up with close to {$1000.00} more than budgeted to be able to pay off the six month items on time. And, then, I have no idea how PayPal plans to deal with what's left of the 24 month promotion payments, because, obviously, I will have paid much more than the agreed upon {$92.00} per month. This last month the excess I ended up paying over the {$92.00} was {$160.00}. I would say, I find this practice dishonest at best and likely fraudulent. Obviously, with PayPal 24 equal monthly payments isn't really that. The interest for anyone who doesn't pay off the items in the 6 months is close to 30 % and, I find it offensive that it appears PayPal is attempting to create situations where people are more likely going to end up paying this interest. Finally, after looking more closely at the statements, I find PayPal 's entire system confusing and, very possibly, arbitrary.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,WA,,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3155814

Since Firstmark Services has received our loan, we have had nothing but trouble. They tried to make us make a payment prior to the end of the 6 month grace period, they provided incorrect information to both me and my husband on separate calls. Furthermore, after my husband made a payment by phone in the amount required by the caller, I received collection calls stating that we still had a past due balance.

My mother experienced financial hardship and, unbeknownst to me, stopped paying her mortgage for over 2 years. I was notified in XXXX by Wells Fargo Bank ( who currently services my home loan ) about this situation and was extremely upset. Wells Fargo employees instructed me that my mother was attempting to modify her home loan and needed my signature on the modification paperwork to do so. I informed Wells Fargo employees that I WOULD NOT consent to signing a modification and advised them that my mother needed to refinance her property in order to remove me from her home loan. Wells Fargo employees instructed me to sign a Quit Claim Deed and advised me that I would be removed from the deed of my mother 's home and the loan ( deed of trust ) for my mother 's residence ( above referenced property ). I signed a Quit Claim Deed in XXXX. I learned in XX/XX/XXXX that Wells Fargo actually modified my mother 's original loan without my knowledge, consent, or signature in XXXX.

2019-01-21,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband I purchased six XXXX  champagne glasses from a vendor, XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, XXXX for the exchange rate price of {$1000.00}. The purchase was based on a model product in the vendor 's showroom, with the final product shipped to us. 
The glasses arrived via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Immediately upon inspecting the product, we found that the quality was defective and the items were not in fact the same as the glasses we viewed in XXXX, and upon which we made the purchase ( different shape, different materials ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the merchant noting that the product was not what we ordered, requesting that they provide the product as represented or a refund. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant responded that the glasses are first quality items, refusing to offer any resolution. We responded again on XX/XX/XXXX, again requesting that the merchant make it right. The merchant did not respond. We reached out to the merchant again on XX/XX/XXXX, noting that the matter would be taken up with our credit card company. No response. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a dispute to Chase for "" item not as described/defective. '' In their response to Chase, the merchant stated that we "" personally selected the six glasses. '' This is not true. As per the original response to us from the merchant, the glasses were made after the fact ; they are not glasses that we selected. The communication I had with Chase was regarding the merchant 's misrepresentation that we purchased the glasses in person. At no time was I ever advised to return the glasses. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase notifying me that my dispute was denied because I "" did not return the merchandise, '' this despite the fact that I was advised by Chase during one of our conversations that we were not required to return the merchandise. I called Chase who advised me to resubmit documents to reopen the dispute. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a request for the dispute to be reopened. On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase once again closed the dispute without speaking to me, again stating that I failed to return the merchandise. This letter was not sent to me directly via mail, despite the fact that I faxed and mailed my dispute letter. Instead it was added to my account notices, which I did not receive until XXXX when I went searching for resolution, having never heard back from Chase. I discovered that without speaking to me, Chase reopened and closed my second dispute in less than 5 business days, without making any efforts to contact me. 
I called Chase again on XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised initially that the dispute was closed. I asked to speak to a supervisor, XXXX. He first advised me that I could have no recourse since it had been "" so long since the original transaction. '' I informed XXXX that this transaction had been in dispute since XXXX so I did not understand why further action would be time barred. He then came back and told me a number of contradictory things. He stated that Visa denied my dispute because they had no evidence that I returned the merchandise. He then stated that returning the merchandise would not make a difference since the contract states that there are no refunds. He then said that I needed to show continuous efforts to resolve the matter with the merchant, even though the merchant had never communicated again with us. I was informed that I was required to make the right efforts to resolve the matter with the merchant now that Chase had denied my dispute. He could not tell me what would constitute right. He repeatedly advised, however that I actually had no recourse so I need not waste my time. I asked if I should return the merchandise and was told he could not or would not advise me to return the merchandise, despite this being the stated reason for denial of my dispute. I was told I should again reach out to the merchant and ask them to accept a return of the merchandise and then I can resubmit to reopen the dispute. I asked why I would be required to continue making futile efforts to communicate with the merchant, when the matter was being disputed by Chase and the merchant had not responded to my repeated inquiries. I also asked what was the point of me resubmitting the dispute if Chase would not bother communicating further with me. 
The experience with Chase has been frustrating and unhelpful. They have not communicated effectively with us and have provided contradictory information. They have also failed to specify exactly what it is we as the victimized consumer should to retain these funds. As noted to the Chase agent, we have done everything asked but they have been unhelpful and have failed to advocate on our behalf. Chases actions have sought to obfuscate this matter and discourage us from pursuing our rightful recourse. I was advised several times during my phone call with XXXX that I should abandon my efforts, which was disappointing and made me feel further victimized.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,782XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3129906

They said we had a {$7400.00} escrow shortage because they made a mistake on our property taxes. For some reason they were billing us half the property taxes but the township was paid in full. 

We are being held liable for these high payments since they spread the escrow shortage over 12 months and added to our monthly payments. 

The loan has been transferred to XXXX XXXX now. 

We have taken a personal loan with a high interest rate and paid off the escrow shortage.

2019-05-31,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"My boyfriend and I ordered some custom grillz from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX fl in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX we live in NC ) merchant advised us the teeth would be overnighted and by XX/XX/XXXX we hadn't recieved them. 
I filed a dispute with my Chase XXXX Visa. Chase gave a temp credit of {$680.00}. 
The merchant responded to the charge back and provided Chase Visa a XXXX tracking number. 
I fought with Chase because I knew we didn't receive the teeth, and yet I had no idea how to prove we hadn't received the teeth. 
I left chase alone & paid the {$680.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX my neighbor had a plumbing emergency and had a plumbing company over. One  of the workers had found a package on the front porch which had my address on it saw me outside in the driveway ( we share a driveway ) and gave me the package. 
Turns out the XXXX delivered to the wrong address ( which has happened before in my rural area ). I have went put of my way to make 2 deliveries of packages to houses on my street. 
When my bf opened the package they were not what we ordered at all. So I contacted my Chase XXXX Visa explained to them the complete situation and apologized for giving them a hard time previously, told them we got the merchandise but it wasnt at all what we ordered and they told me to send it back to XXXX ask for a refund and wait 12 to 15 days for the merchant to give us a refund, if after the 12 days had passed they would process a refund for my {$680.00} once I called them back and provide a XXXX number for our return. So we did that. Never got a refund or response from the merchant and Chase XXXX visa hadn't been responding to my redispute and I had not seen a credit back to my card. So I kept in contact with chase customer service and on 3 different occasions from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX was assured that I would be getting a refund from multiple customer service reps. XXXX I called into chase and had my issue escalated ended up speaking with a lady named XXXX, she advised me that anytime I sent a secured message to them regarding anything to do with this merchant or merchandise or initial dispute a rep would go in the message center and just delete without responding stated that XX/XX/XXXX I was advised in writing that no future further action regarding this dispute would EVER happen. So I asked XXXX why all of the other reps never told me this, why they advised me to send back the merchandise and chase would process a refund? XXXX just said she was very sorry I was not aware of the XX/XX/XXXX letter and there was nothing further She was able to do for me. I asked if I could speak to someone above her and turns out She Is her own supervisor and must own JP Morgan Chase bank she told me there was noone else that I could verbally speak with I could write a letter to the executive office but there wasn't a number. 
I found the number. 
I contact the executive branch. They take my complaint. I'm assigned a man named XXXX. He advises me he would be back in touch with me within a couple of business days. The executive office told me it's their job to figure out if there was any wrong doing in the disputes department throughout my case, and then they make things right. I hadn't heard back from XXXX. I follow up on XX/XX/XXXX no response I call again XX/XX/XXXX and he finally calls me back stats that he only could find a few calls and absolutely no secure messages through their mesg center. I advised him he needed to recheck letting him know I have screen shots of the secured messages and also some recordings of phone calls he states he can not find. He asks to have a couple of hours and call me back with his new research findings. XXXX calls me back and has found some calls and listened to the recordings and admits that I was correct, however, they are not willing to reimburse me for my {$680.00}. He's not willing to take responsibility for Chase customer service reps advising me to send the merchandise back and get a refund, In the phone calls he did review he didn't find THAT call, there isn't anything in writing from me thru their secure message center and they can't find the phone calls I'm referring to regarding their employees telling me what to do and stating I'm not responsible for a product that I havent used and have returned and or that's incorrect. XXXX denies some phone calls he still can't find so I let him know I'm going to my cell provider and get a print out fron XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX to show me contacting them and the duration of those calls. XXXX had already told me Chase did not place any notes into my account and doesn't have to input due dilligence. After XXXX admitted he found that there in fact was misconduct on their part, he told me he found opportunities for coaching with 2 or 3 employees. States hes not willing to take responsibility for Chase customer service reps advising me to send the merchandise back and get a refund, in the phone calls he did review he didn't find THAT call, there isn't anything in writing from me thru their secure message center and he wasn't able to find the phone calls I'm referring to regarding their employees telling me what to do and stating I'm not responsible for a product that I havent used and have returned and or that's incorrect! He found coaching opportunities! That doesn't put my {$680.00} back into my account! And surely doesn't make things right! I have screen shots of the secure messages that I sent with acknowledgement from chase they received my messages. This blows my mind!

I made every payment ; occasionally a week or 2 late. However, payments were always made. I had a payment not clear because they cashed the check before the payment was due and the check was dated for, however they continued to cash my checks afterwards. XX/XX/XXXX, a repo man showed up at my job to take possession of my car. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because I could see on my bank account that they had received my payment. they advised they were not going to cash the check and wanted cash for the current payment, the next month 's as well as the fee for the repossession. As I was in XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX is in XXXX, the time difference didn't allow for me to get to the bank for the cash as it was already past XXXX est. I had no choice but to let the repossession to happen. On my credit report they show my account current until after XX/XX/XXXX at which point I no longer had the vehicle. I received notification they were outing the car up for auction, however I never received any paperwork after the sale of the car. They charged off {$9500.00} for what I can only assume is the amount they sold the vehicle for. I initially financed {$12000.00}, making 7 months of payments of $ XXXX. I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX on multiple occasions to request proof of sale at the auction. they have refused to provide me the requested information or allow me to speak to the person who can provide me the information. 

If the initial loan was {$12000.00} and they sold the vehicle for {$9500.00} at the very least my balance should be {$3200.00} ; however the payments I've made should be factored in the balance as well.

I was told I would be called back by Friday, which I never was. I call another person in the internal collection department, who told me they would need to verify which department my account belonged to, and it could take two weeks. Well over a month later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called because I received neither a letter, phone call or email from Barclay Card. I reached someone today who told me my voicemails may not of been responded to, because I didn't include enough information in the voicemail beyond my phone number. While the agent ( who was actually a manager ), did not seem very apologetic, she informed me that this missing information is why I was not called back, however it does not say in the voicemail what needs to be left. I asked about a settlement offer and was given an amount and percentage, which worked out to be {$760.00}. I was told I would only have 90 days to pay it, which is not enough given my current financial situation. I asked about paying the balance to have the account deleted and was told this was against "" fair credit reporting laws ''. The FCRA does not prohibit deletion as I'm sure the CFPB already knows. I actually searched online and found numerous cases of Barclay Card removing tradelines. Paid for charge offs report the same as unpaid, so it would be of no benefit to me to pay it.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,IA,523XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3309863

I also sent out letters to the actual creditors, asking both the credit bureaus as well as the creditors for original signed consumer contract as stated in Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Report Act. 

After no response or verification from either the creditors nor the bureaus, I sent more notarized certified letters out dated XX/XX/2019. Again, I did not get any verification of ANY signed consumer contract as stated in Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Report Act. 

On XX/XX/2019, after still NO VERIFICATION and NO RESPONSE from either creditor or the Bureaus, I sent another round of letters asking for verification as stated in Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Report Act. AGAIN FRUSTRATINGLY WITH NO RESPONSE!!! 

On XX/XX/2019, AGAIN,, I sent a final round of letters as a final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding refusal to delete UNVERIFIED information from my consumer file. AGAIN NO RESPONSE!!! 

The unverified accounts on my record have damaged my good name by not allowing me to obtain credit. I know for a fact that all of these letters were delivered and read by all parties they were sent to, and still i had not received any consumer signed contract as verification as stated BY LAW these entities MUST PROVIDE ME. 

I'm past any resolution on this matter and demand that ALL INFORMATION be deleted that was not verified, including all hard inquiries. These supposed creditors and the 3 main credit bureaus have had 81 days to respond to my legal demands and have failed to do so. I'm writing this complaint as an initial request to make this right before I pursue legal action.

I had been dealing with several issues of identity theft, related to my ex-husband 's theft of my credit cards and personal information. The bills for this card were not going to my address as a result of this. When I was alerted to the debt, I attempted to get the debt consolidated with XXXX XXXX XXXX, an organization I had been working with to pay off the debts accrued by my ex husband, in an effort to repair my credit. XXXX XXXX made it very difficult to consolidate under this program, even though I was able to do this easily with my bank, which had recommended the program as a legitimate non-profit debt consolidation ( not forgiveness ) program. 

I spoke to an XXXX representative and explained the situation to the individual on the phone, stating that I would pay off the debt in full, but that I wanted adverse information about the debt off my credit report, as I had not acquired the debt, nor had I received any indication the debt had been accrued, since the bills were not sent to my address. 

I agreed to a lump sum payoff under the understanding that this adverse information would be removed from my credit report. The cost was substantial to me, around {$10000.00}, but it was worth the price of fixing my credit and moving on from the debts accrued in my name. I was under the impression the individual I spoke with on the phone agreed to these terms. However, several months later, the adverse information is still on my credit report and, in fact, until last month, XXXX XXXX was still reflecting that I had not paid the debt, though I had done so more than a year earlier. 

I am very distressed by this situation, as the identity theft has severely impacted my credit score and made it nearly impossible to move on from my divorce and find a new home for myself and my children. I would like this issue resolved, and for further advice on how to remove other negative items on my report that have been the result of identity theft.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NJ,070XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3297075

So they forgot to fund my car loan, making me late with my original lender and costing me daily finance charges for 10 days to pay two car loans from two lenders on one car. And they rectified that by forgetting to fund the gift card to reimburse the 10 days of finance charges that they charged me for a loan I never had because they forgot to fund it. Is such a coincidence even possibly accidental? Here is my original complaint, which I reassert since it is entirely unresolved by this {$0.00} balance, UNFUNDED, gift card.

Documentation as to whether or not I received intravenous contrast dye was poor. Middle record records indicate I received the contrast dye after the procedure was completed. The radiology company administering the test identified an error in their medical record system that they have not corrected. Thus they can not prove objectively that contrast was administered except to look at the radiology films which they have not provided me in a readable format. Despite the radiology company having my correct address and telephone number, I never received any bills at my residence for this service. They then sent the bill to the respondent for debt collection. Despite having the correct address and telephone number for my residence from the radiology company and having access to my credit report, the debt collector made no verifiable attempt to give me a call by telephone or send me a letter. They claim that they sent me a letter via regular mail but they can not prove its being sent or being received. Despite having my correct address and telephone number and access to my credit file, The debt collector continue to call an unrelated individual with the same last name. After not receiving a satisfactory response or payment, they placed the adverse account to my credit report. This caused me to lose a high security job offer worth {$180000.00} in salary annually.

I have e-mails on my end making numerous attempts to verify any information and at the end of the day for the company to tell me Im responsible for the loan ( even though I didnt receive payment ) because they cant trace where the payment went so their acting as if I did receive funds.

On the banking end, I online bank with XXXX. Ive also contacted this company in order to figure out where the funds went because when a ACH is initiated the my name and social security number is encrypted in order to verify the correct personal has received payment.

Navient became the my creditor. First off they said I received a $ XXXXXXXX refund after the consolidation, which I never received or even heard about. 

When I originally had my loans consolidated by the XXXX XXXX XXXX they were $ XXXXXXXX ( approx. ) When I began making payments to Navient, my loans were suddenly over {$80000.00} ( approx ). I have been paying on these loans since XX/XX/XXXX monthly and they haven't decreased at all. 

I called Navient to find out how I could address my student loan debt as my principle amount continued to increase despite payments recommended by Navient. I asked about loan forgiveness because I worked for a non-profit drug and alcohol treatment program as a counselor for many years. I was told that Navient did not offer loan forgiveness. I asked the young woman if there was someone else I could speak to about my options and she told me she was the supervisor and she wished she could help me, she understood my frustration because she had student loans herself she had to pay back. There was nothing they could do for me. I said how can my loans be increasing if I am paying the interest plus principle ( approx $ XXXX. ). She said she didn't know. 

Several months later I called again as I had resigned from my position and was on unemployment. Navient instructed me to get a forbearance on my loans. I did so until I was off unemployment and employed again. They suggested I 2xs that I do an interest only re-payment plan. 


I believe Navient manipulated my ignorance and did not guide me well with repayment options. I believed that Navient misguided me into a forbearance as well as an interest only payment to profit from my ignorance. I further believe that Navient either recorded a refund that they never sent me or that this refund as a result of my loan consolidation was fabricated for their benefit. Finally I believe that Navient hires debt counselors that are not qualified to advise students about their debts to Navient. Taking advantage of students for profit is wrong.

2019-03-04,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"Westlake Portfolio Management , LLC ( Westlake ) has refused to reimburse funds from over-payment amount of {$7200.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). And correct and close my account to paid in full with {$0.00} balance. When Westlake knowingly cashed two cashier checks {$7200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX then Force-paid the claimed loss cashier check on XX/XX/XXXX {$7200.00} in total {$14000.00} cashed under false pretense of ( 1 ) auto loan initial payoff amount {$7100.00} is unconscionable conduct and needs to be investigated. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Westlake to get a payoff quote for refinance purposes with XXXX. I was at XXXX and had the loan specialist speak to Westlake representative ( rep ) and was told the payoff quote amount is $ XXXX.After being approved for the auto refinanced loan at XXXX, Westlake was again contacted to confirm exact mailing address for the payoff check to be mailed. Westlake/Rep stated to be sure to add the per diem expense for the days in the mail to the payoff amount or the check will be insufficient funds. A cashier check dated XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$7200.00} was sent to Westlake for my auto loan payoff. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXXI contacted Westlake after receiving a bill for past-due payments owed for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX car payments. After speaking with Westlake Supervisor/XXXX   stating they ( Westlake ) never receive cashier check {$7200.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately contacted XXXX and spoke with XXXX Supervisor/XXXX and placed all parties on conference call to alleviate this matter quickly. With Westlake/XXXX   repeating they never received any payoff cashier check in amount {$7200.00}. XXXX/XXXX  stated let her try and follow-up or try and locate the cashier check {$7200.00}. Westlake/XXXX  stated the fees and dues may still apply, but if we ( Westlake ) at fault and got lost in mail it will be waived and not charged to your account and Westlake will honor the original cashier check {$7200.00} as payoff I have to go. XXXX/XXXX stated she will place a block on the initial cashier check {$7200.00}, don't worry just sign a declaration of loss so I can get you a replacement cashier check for payoff to Westlake. XXXX/XXXX   directs me to go to my branch/bank and pick-up the replacement cashier check for payoff to Westlake. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I returned to bank and as directed got the replacement cashier check in the amount of {$7200.00} withdrew from my saving account at XXXX for auto loan payoff to be sent to Westlake. On XX/XX/XXXX again I contacted Westlake to see if they received the replacement cashier check {$7200.00} for payoff and close my account paid in full and send my Title to XXXX. Westlake Supervisor/XXXX XXXX did confirm Westlake recieved and cashed the replacement cashier check {$7200.00}. However, Westlake/James states they have located the initial payoff cashier check {$7200.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX. But I need to contact XXXX to give Westlake permission to cash with ( XXXX ) letter head on the letter, since your loan payment for this month XXXX is due amount of {$330.00} is your remaining balance everything else on your account is paid off and your Title will be sent after you pay this last payment.On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX and spoke with XXXX  Specialist/XXXX  and expressed what Westlake Supervisor/XXXX stated to me needing XXXX authorization to cash the initial cashier check {$7200.00}. XXXX/XXXX  informed me that Westlake has already cashed BOTH cashier checks back-to-back the first was {$7200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and the claimed loss check or they suppose never received cashier check {$7200.00} was then Force-Paid on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I contacted Westlake again and spoke with Westlake Supervisor/XXXX XXXX and let him know that XXXX Specialist/XXXX  was on the conference call to confirm not only the cashier check {$7200.00} was not lost in the mail but Westlake cashed it and cashed the replacement cashier check {$7200.00} making total amount {$14000.00} cashed for ( 1 ) auto loan payoff initial amount {$7100.00}. Creating over-payment and reimbursement {$7200.00} needs to be mailed to XXXX immediately. Westlake/XXXX  confirmed and stated the reimbursement funds will be mailed to XXXX and got the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX/XXXX  to exactly where to send reimbursement funds. 
Westlake openly refuses to send reimbursement funds {$7200.00} to XXXX and have stop billing me for an account that has been paid in full and needs to be closed, immediately. Westlake knowingly doubled paid themselves in the amount of {$14000.00} for ( 1 ) payoff initial  debt amount {$7100.00} and continue to charge bogus fees to the same account is unconscionable conduct and fraudulent behavior that is unacceptable and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) needs to sanction and alleviate such company actions expeditiously.I contacted Westlake Portfolio Management LLC ; Westlake/Group President/XXXX XXXX ; Westlake/Chairman of the Board/XXXX XXXX, via phone and emails all to no avail. Once Westlake knowingly or should have known cashed the checks for payment is considered to be Acceptance of the Offer and extinguishes the debt, not in some but the debt in entirety.",,"Westlake Services, LLC",NC,275XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3168842

2018-11-26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"","On XX/XX/2018, my intent was to pay off my mortgage with PHH Mortgage. I could not wire funds as my bank was in New York State and I was told I had to come into the office in NY and I am in Florida. I decided to do an e-check for the principal balance, and a follow-up e-check for the remaining daily interest and {$10.00} recording fee. Both payments were put into a suspense account by PHH on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively. They told me they needed 10 business days because the funds were not certified. Payoff figures were for XX/XX/18. I was told by TWO customer service reps that my property taxes ( due XX/XX/XXXX to avoid paying additional tax ) would NOT be paid because of the payoff intent, and that the escrow was frozen. I didn't think this was appropriate as they were not going to post my payments until close to when the tax bill was due ( with discounts ). I waited until XX/XX/XXXX, and processed an e-check for {$7.00}, xxx.xx from my bank to XXXX County Tax Collector in Florida. Today, PHH states that they sent a bulk check on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX County for the same amount to pay my taxes. PHH says if they were to request the funds back, it would take FOUR MONTHS for me to get my monies back. ( I still have about {$1900.00} left in escrow as well, which they tell me would take about 3 weeks to receive the refund ). I then called XXXX County, and they said they have not yet processed the bulk payment, and would probably do so either XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. Even though I told them I already paid, and that my mortgage will be paid off today ( they are to apply the suspense payments today to full pay the account ), they refuse to send me the overpayment, and state that it must go back to the payer ( PHH ). XXXX County says it could take 4-6 weeks for the monies to be sent back to PHH. I don't think I should have to wait four months for my money.

Around the end of XX/XX/XXXX they agreed to review my short sale and sent out an appraiser to get the value of the house. Their value came back higher than our buyers offer of XXXX. Despite their lower value, they told us they were looking to get XXXX. We immediately went back on the market to look for that value. We were able to get the original buyer to come up to meet their counter, and when we did they refused to review it as they had set an auction date and claimed we did not have enough time to submit it for a review. They claimed they had issues getting into the property a second time which caused some delays in them getting another value, but we never received a call from any appraiser. They finally sent someone on XX/XX/XXXX and my realtor had to meet them out there to make sure they would get in. At this point another auction date was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX so we were still on a time crunch. They got their value back at the same as it was previously XX/XX/XXXX and asked us to wait til after the holidays for an approval. After the holidays we were told that they were looking to NET XXXX even though their valuation of the property came back at XXXX and said their investor would no longer look at a short sale.

So I decided to get security cameras. I had a email from this company so I responded and spoke to a lady who quoted me a price of XXXX dollars for this system. It included so I thought the front and back door camera 's. After the installation they gave you 3 days to cancel, but there was no reason to cancel it was working well. Then I finally got the bill about 30 days later and it was for over 800.00. I was floored. When I called the company they told me that some one would get back to me, no one ever did. The finance company said they went on what XXXX told them and they submitted 800+. When I spoke to someone at XXXX he stated XXXX was for the kit which I thought I was getting, but that I had an extra camera added. The front door camera. I explained to the that this was not within my budget and no one every told be anything about an extra camera I had to pay for or I would have told them to forget it. He told me that I would have to speak to someone in management who would listen to the initial call to see what was said. No one ever contacted me back so I called again. This time I spoke to a very rude lady. I explained that at the time of the sale, I asked the sales person what was better about her company and why I should go with them instead of another company that didn't require any out of pocket for cameras or installation. She was just a very nice person who seemed to be very concerned about my safety, that's how they got me. She told me they had better cameras and she was very comforting. I thought she was trying to help me, I was so concerned about what was going on around my house, that was really all I could think of. The only money this lady spoke of was XXXX. She never told me anything about 800+ dollars, she did say I would get a free camera. I feel like I was baited and switched. When I called again they told me that someone would get back to me with the voice recording of the sales pitch, but no one ever has. They are billing me XXXX a month for this 800.00+ for this equipment. I called today to get the pay off balance and to see where to send the check and they told me there is no place to send the check you have to do it on line. That was it for me. I'm not going to pay them XXXX a month for the rest of my life for this XXXX equipment I'll pay them off, but I just want to know has anybody else had this experience with this company and what if anything can I do.

I began the purchase of my home in XX/XX/XXXX and made the first payment of {$170.00} in XXXX of the same year. Now, twenty years later, after having paid 237 of 240 payments, my loan is at maturation. One of those last three payments was deferred a few months ago. The other two, I have refused to pay, until I receive the fully itemized account of my payment history, including the amount of the loan ( {$17000.00} ), the fixed rate of interest of 9.5 % ( no idea as to how it has been compounded ) ) ; the amount that has been applied to the interest, and the amount that has been applied to the principal. I made three oral requests in XXXX, and then one by email ( sent XX/XX/XXXX ), as I was finally instructed. On that same day, I was sent a reply from Ditech that my request had been received, and a representative would be in contact with me. 

A representative did indeed call and simply started asking me questions for which the answers were in my written request. I told the representative that I wasn't answering any questions ; that everything was in the email. I then told the person to simply send me the information I had requested ; and then we would talk. This is XX/XX/XXXX, and I have yet to have that requested information sent to me. However, representatives from Ditech continue to call every day, sometimes twice a day. 

Since the date of my first payment, I have paid 237 payments at {$170.00} a payment, for a total of {$40000.00}. That is on a {$17000.00} loan. I would think that my debt would be satisfied ; but Ditech still has me owing {$3400.00}. ( Three home owner 's insurance premiums ( that's another story ) of {$84.00} each, are included in this amount. ) In conclusion, I am of the opinion that my debt has been more than satisfied.

I repeatedly and tenaciously attempted to do this both online and via telephone. The Experian website offered me a P.I.N. that I could give to my bank to temporarily unlock my credit report, but my bank told me that they could not use a P.I.N., and that I should call Experian for assistance. 

Contacting Experian has been time consuming, frustrating, miserable, fruitless and IMPOSSIBLE! Experian is wasting my time, depriving me of the credit that I deserve, and XXXX me off. The government ought to put Experian out of business tomorrow morning. 

First I had to go on a treasure hunt for a telephone number to contact Experian, because a telephone number is either very well hidden or else nonexistent on the Experian website. I used several telephone numbers that I found on the internet and called them to no avail. Each Experian number I called required me to wade through seemingly endless voice prompts, starting with "" For English, press 1 '' which is to accommodate, at my expense, mind you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

When I finally was finished growing older and older and older and older while wading through computerized voice prompts, the end result for each of the several telephone numbers that I called REPEATEDLY was a recorded message telling me that Experian could not assist me, or words to that effect, along with a monotone apology and a suggestion that I "" try again later '', followed by disconnection.

2019-02-14,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was a victim of fraud and forgery while using my American Express Credit Card. I am writing to plead for assistance from The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and ask for a thorough investigation with American Express, as they are condoning, disregarding and quite frankly encouraging fraudulent behaviors from their vendors/merchants. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my American Express credit card was charges 11 times for a total amount of {$8800.00} from a merchant named XXXX XXXX. I only authorized/signed for 2 charges - {$190.00} and {$1000.00}. I contacted American Express immediately once I noticed the pending charges. In speaking to the agent/representative, we were convinced the charges were an error as there were numerous and duplicate charges minutes apart from each other. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, all the charges posted and I immediately contacted American Express. The agent explained to me that they will open a billing dispute/inquiry with the merchant and made me feel comfortable that the charges are inaccurate and AMEX will get to the bottom of it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email with an AMEX Message. The message was a note from the merchant stating that I am a regular customer and a copy of 5 out of 11 receipts. I have never been to this establishment prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I reviewed the receipts and noticed my signature was forged on 4 of the 5 receipts ( the {$190.00} receipt being the only one I signed/authorized ). I did not authorized nor was I aware of the 4 other receipts. None of the descriptions on the receipts decipherable. Once again I immediately contacted AMEX, and explained them the charges were fraudulent and my signature was forged. They transferred me to the Fraud department and I was assured that AMEX is going to initiate a thorough investigation. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called AMEX looking for a status update and an update on the remaining receipts. The agent/representative explained to me the investigation is still pending and they have not received the additional receipts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I returned a call to the Fraud department as they left me a voicemail. The agent/representative from the Fraud dept. explained to me that the fraud team will not investigate this case because I was present at the establishment with the card. The agent/representative requested I contact customer care to continue to investigate the case. I did not understand how this is not fraud as I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged. I was told by the agent on XX/XX/XXXX that this was fraud and she transferred me to the fraud team. If this is not fraud I do not know what is Either way, I then contacted customer care again and the agent/representative explained to me that there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route. I was so devastated and disappointed with the agent/representative approach and response that I had to end the phone call. I took some time to compose myself from the disappointing way the previous agent/representative address the situation. I called back a few hours later and requested to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor ( XXXX ) came on the line and immediately repeated the same message the previous agent/representative provide me ( there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route ) without listening to my concerns. I explained to her that I do not feel this was handled accordingly from AMEX from the very beginning. 
i.e. 
How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other There are 4 separate cases/inquires open and the agent/representative could not explain why 4 were open vs 1. They could also not explained why 1 was closed out the other 3 were still open nor can I decipher why The agent/representative agreed this was fraud and transferred me to the Fraud dept., the Fraud dept. did not even investigate the case even though I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged The agents/representatives and supervisor could not provide me any updates on the case or updates on the remaining receipts on every call I made to customer care.

There was a credit on my account for {$1100.00} ( {$390.00}, {$290.00}, {$290.00} and {$190.00} ). Two agent/representative could not explain the credit and the supervisor ( XXXX ) stated the credit was from the merchant b/c of the duplicated charges. Shortly after this was explained to me, I receive an email stating the credit is being reversed. 
Communication and updates have been poor and inadequate The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) At this point, I contacted and engaged the District Attorneys office to notify them of the fraud and unjust business practice from this merchant. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I send an email to a member of the American Express Leadership team, to express my concerns on how American Express has managed and addressed the investigation/matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from an American Express Executive Assistant, stating they have received my email and are reviewing my inquires and concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the same American Express Executive Assistant, with an attached resolution letter stating We have extensively researched your concerns and determined all claims were investigated and correctly decisioned, because of the fact I was present at the establishment. Their outcome of all claims resulted in the following credits : {$1900.00} ( Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code ), {$500.00} ( tip amount from the {$1500.00} charge ), {$400.00} ( tip amount from the {$1100.00} charge ), and {$80.00} ( tip amount from the {$200.00} charge ).

I responded with my concern that this was not thoroughly and extensively reviewed as they stated. And requested a call to discuss the actions and steps that were taken to extensively research my concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to the same American Express Executive Assistant, to review and address my concerns. I ask a number of questions and what steps/process were taken regarding how American Express came to their decision. She was very abrupt and refused to answer specific questions. Her common response was You were at the establishment. I explained to her that their vendor/merchant had possession of my American Express Credit Card for the duration of my stay at their business. During that time span, they processed 11 separate simultaneous charges without my authorization. They then provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. Because I was at the establishments does not mean I authorized the charges. Below are a few of the concern I attempted to discuss with the American Express Executive Assistant to no avail. 
Why was I, nor the vendor/merchant, not physically contacted ( Called ) during the investigation Did American Express review the Merchants history An explanation of the Charges ( I can not decipher the descriptions on the receipts And the merchant would not return my call ) Why certain tips were credited and not others. 
o Her explanation was, any receipt with an X marked on the line for a tip would be credited. 
o There were receipts with X marked on the tip line that were credited and not credited o She stated she will look into why there was inconsistency on American Express 's part with the credit issued for the tips Why was only one charge of {$1900.00} was credited.

o She states the Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code o I requested the purpose and meaning of entering the authorization and she refused to explain it to me.

Why did I not receive all of the requested receipts until weeks/months later from American Express ... I requested them numerous times and they finally provided 10 out of the 11 receipts to me in batches when they clearly had all of them from the beginning. ( I am still missing 1 receipt including the receipt I signed for {$1000.00} ) I received endless inconsistency with the credits provided. I was provided numerous credits on separate occasions and then the credits were removed on separate occasions. As a matter of fact, shortly after my call with the American Express Executive Assistant, where she went through and confirmed my credits, I received notice the same credit is being removed.

Inconsistent messaging form American Express employees o The numerous/separate cases caused inconsistent responses/messages from the customer care agents every time I called in. The Communication and updates were poor and inadequate. Each Customer Care Agents provided me a different and inaccurate update or were not able to provide me any updates at all.

The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other, while the vendor/merchant had possession of my Credit Card. They provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. 


I am pleading with The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter. The fact that American Express accepts/allows this vendor to provide dishonest business practice and fraud to any patron is unacceptable, disturbing and frightening. How can American Express support, allow and accept this merchant to continue to provide unfair, dishonest and fraudulent business practice in our community?

2019-01-09,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","My husband died on XX/XX/XXXX, or XX/XX/XXXX. He died in his sleep. At the time of his death he had a home mortgage with Wells Fargo Bank. The property involved here was a property left to him by his mother.So even though we lived there the property was considered separate property. At the time of his death, I was not sure weather he had paid the mortgage so on XX/XX/XXXX I went to a Wells Fargo branch and advised them that my husband had died and I wanted to make sure his mortgage had been paid for the month. I requested that they advise the life events division that he had died. They accepted the payment. I advised that I would bring the death certificate when I received it.When I got the death certificate I went to a branch and gave them a copy of the death certificate, again requesting that it be forwarded to the life events division. I also made the XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment. I also called Wells Fargo and advised that my husband had died and that I was calling about separate property. They would not speak with me because I was not on the loan. I sent them a copy of the death certificate and again requested that someone contact me in reference to me becoming the Successor in Interest on this loan. I continued to make payments until XX/XX/XXXX. When I attempted to make payment in XXXX they advised that they could not take the payment because it was delinquent when he died. I advised that I had been making payments and had requested to be placed on the loan as Successor in Interest. I also advised Wells Fargo that my husband had a minor child when he died and that I was attempting to become his Conservator/guardian so that I could resolve this matter for both our interest in probate court. I again requested the paperwork to begin the Successor in Interest designation. I advised that under Dodd Frank and the CFPB guidance there was NO ability to repay process to become the Successor In Interest. Wells Fargo still would not start the process. I had been in contact with Wells Fargo weekly in reference to the Successor In Interest process. I requested that my request be sent to the legal division because the people I was dealing with did not know what I was referring to. I also gave them the information relating to my stepson 's conservatorship. They sent a letter about reinstating the loan and I advised that this would be included in the Successor in Interest and reminded them that they had refused to take payments from me after XX/XX/XXXX. I again requested to be put on the loan. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice to vacate my home advising that it had been sold on XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any notice of any foreclosure as it related to the property. Nothing came in the mail or was served on the Estate of my husband or to me. I was forced to go to court to stop the eviction. After researching the foreclosure I discovered that the foreclosure had been processed in the name of my deceased Mother in Law. No paperwork appeared in my mailbox relating to my husband! The loan on this case had been in my husbands name since XXXX. It also took him great difficulty to put the loan in his name after his mother 's death. Nothing relating to this loan should have been processed in his Mother 's name after he became the obligatory on the loan. I was forced at great expense to go to Court to stop the eviction. Because I was dealing with Wells Fargo and because of all of the reputational issues relating to the fraud perpetrated against its customers I was able to convince the Judge to dismiss the eviction. I again requested that I be made Successor in Interest. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Wells Fargo advised that they had the legal right to foreclose in my Mother 's in Law name without notice to my husband 's estate or to me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,TX,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3120873

Actually we are not responsible for the late payment. As per the deal the dealer gave they were supposed to pay the first two payment : the one that you pay during the signing of the lease and the second one which is the one that will be officially billed by the finance department. Dealership forgot and I came to know about this when I went online to pay my bill from XXXX XXXX which I am supposed to pay. The dealership owned up the mistake and paid the one they had to pay. Infiniti finance refused to update the incorrect credit reporting and asked me to submit proofs for all this. I called in created a ticket with customer service and submitted the required docs. Processing time is 6-8 weeks and they don't send you an email with decision you have to keep calling and they will just close it after they make a decision. Since XX/XX/XXXX to this date XX/XX/XXXX I have opened multiple tickets with their customer service. Each time they bring up new issue with the documentations. ie lets say there are five things they wanted in the body of the letter they tell one each time they reject. And finally, one of the customer service agent himself dictated the body of the letter to me so that the dealer can print this in their letter pad and then I can submit it. Now they rejected that also. The dealership clearly states that it was their fault etc but they just will find new issues all the time. As I am typing this the customer service agent I am working with is trying to come up with new wording to cater towards the new rejection reasons from infiniti finance. They are just so painful and so irresponsible. I am not sure why they have to do this even when their own customer service agents says they can not figure the reason why they keep rejecting the letter or the plea to correct the incorrect credit reporting. 

Now latest rejection reason which they didn't tell when they rejected before is that they want the dealership to put in the letter why they made a late payment and why they are agreeing to pay it on my behalf. 

Similar is my experience with another ticket I have with them. I got a parking ticket and I paid on time. They paid it again after I paid it without consulting me. And now they have not recouped the money from the city for months now and I will have to pay the same amount again to infiniti. 

Their investigation takes more than 30 days, I am not being notified of the results, there is difficulty submitting or get details of a dispute etc. I need somebody to help me. They make you feel helpless. Because of this incorrect reporting I got rejected for my wife 's student loan refinancing and finally when we got a refinancing we got a lower rate than we should have as because of all this my credit score went down from 800s to lower 700s.",,NISSAN MOTOR ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION,MA,018XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-31,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3260102

We have worked long and hard to build an exemplary credit history and had a strong credit score of XXXX. We had no late payments and no negative reports. As part of my husbands preparation for treatment, knowing that he wouldnt be able to manage our finances regularly, he set up automatic payments on our {$4500.00} XXXX credit card debt, amounting to {$150.00} per month ( above the minimum ), to continue until he was able to return to health and make further arrangements. 

Unfortunately, without our knowledge, interest on our debt increased and our pre-arranged payments no longer covered our monthly obligation. Thirty- and Sixty days late charges began to accumulate, and as a result, our credit score dropped to XXXX. XXXX XXXX recorded our dropping score, but didnt reflect any issues with XXXX. The cause of the decline was, at first, a mystery. 

As soon as we learned about this situation, just over two weeks ago, we called XXXX to resolve the issue and make arrangements to pay off the balance. We were told the debt was out of their hands and had been sent to collections. 

We spoke to our local branch manager, Mrs. XXXX XXXX, who understood our situation and attempted to solve the problem. She explained our predicament to a relevant supervisor, only to face the same response : We cant do anything. 

Though we can provide proof that we never missed a payment, our credit remains severely damaged. Again, our credit shows no late payments. In fact, our credit report shows no late payments from any of 15 other creditors. Only an insane person would pay everybody else and disregard one creditor. After working years to establish perfect credit, our compromised credit score means we can not refinance our home or pursue our life plans. The direct impact on our lives, however, is far more fundamental. 

Our efforts toward establishing perfect credit are part of our dream to establish a family. I have recently found out that I cant have children of my own. We have been working with the XXXX XXXX adoption agency in XXXX XXXX to adopt a child, that is my life long dream. I was born in XXXX as my father was U.S. Military and my mother XXXX. This low credit score will disqualify us from adoption.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NV,891XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-04-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3199553

On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the balance in full ( {$3200.00} ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I was assessed an interest charge of {$40.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One customer service to inquire about the interest charge since I had paid the balance in full by the due date. The first person I spoke to said she could not determine why I got the charge and then consulted with someone else. One hour later ( put on hold numerous times ), the other person told me that interest was charged from the time the statement came out ( XX/XX/XXXX ) until the day it was paid off ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I then asked what the purpose of the due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) was if interest was going to be charged from the day the statement was sent and not the due date. The rep said I had been under a 0 % interest rate for 12 months but the promo expired on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked how I would've known that interest would've started accumulating that day and not after the due date as it is with most companies?? She advised it should have been in the welcome packet I received in XX/XX/XXXX ( over a year ago ) when I opened the account ; she said they don't provide any notifications on the statements. She refused to remove the interest charge and when I asked to speak to someone else regarding the issue, I was advised I would have to call back and get someone else. I then called back and asked for a supervisor again who also refused to remove the interest charge. I explained I thought it was a deceptive business practice to begin charging interest on the date the statement was sent and not after the due date. I then requested to close my account if that is the way the company operates and is unwilling to credit an interest charge ( that should've never been applied ) for a good customer. They promptly closed my account without trying to retain me. I do not think it is fair for me to have to pay the interest charge and am requesting it be removed. I would've paid the balance in full on the day I received the statement if it was stated that I needed to. I never pay interest fees on any card. I feel the way they are handling this promo and interest rate period is very deceptive and an easy way to get unsuspecting customers to pay an interest charge as soon as the promo ends.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-16,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3307446

2019-02-05,Debt collection,I do not know,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"I received a 1099-C form from a debt collector for a debt that I have tried to get information on but have never received proper verification that I have previously requested. From verbal conversations it appears to be some sort of home loan that I took out in XX/XX/2008 through my mortgage company, XXXX. During the mortgage crisis my home went into foreclosure and the company was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was able to modify my home loan and refinance all the debts owed at that time. I have since refinanced my home and am in good standing. Any prior home loans were taken out as secured by my lenders and when modified I received reconveyances and title insurance. This appears to be a scam and a modification of my original secured home loan that was refinanced. Apparently, they believe they can collect as unsecured but won't give me any information to date.

Since Lending Club does not offer to refinance, I had to apply for the 2nd loan. 
I applied and went through weeks of endless phone calls, submissions of various documents, which they kept requesting after each submission and NEVER, EVER requested the first time. 

To my complete shock, I GOT DENIED! With the credit score 120 points higher than when I applied for the previous loan, with the perfect 100 % record of paying on time, with the income higher than the previous year, basically, every score higher than it was when I applied the first time in XX/XX/2018, and I got denied, because these predators at the Lending Club don't want to lose their highway robbery interest of 22.75 % they are charging me on the current loan. 

The refinance interest would be 13 %, high, but not as insane as 22.75, but they said the amount I wanted to borrow was too high relative to my earnings, while they gave me a lot more with the income a lot less within 10 minutes back in XX/XX/2018. 

They want me locked into 5 years of the financial slavery where I would be paying more than {$15000.00} in interest instead of 3 yrs 1/3 of the previous amount in interest.

With the refinance I would be paying a basically similar monthly amount, which I was paying until today, and they had absolutely NO problems with me making these payments. They had NO problem whatsoever loaning me much higher amount the first time.

On my report, it lists the liabilities and assets being {$0.00}. This is not accurate and you can see this highlighted on the report attached. On several dates, I received the response from the bureau stating they verified the information. I then sent a letter to the XXXX County Court Clerk 's office asking if they verified the information to the bureaus. They sent me a letter stating that they do not provide information to the bureaus. The XXXX creditor was sent a letter for verification and validation and they have not responded to my request and have exceeded the mandatory 30 day time limit. XXXX XXXX was also contacted and has not sent verification. 

My complaint is this, I challenged the Items based upon the inaccurate reporting of the {$0.00} assets and {$0.00} Liabilities on my report for the BK. Pertaining to the XXXX account, they have not responded to certified mail and confirmed verification and validation of their inaccurate reporting. The XXXX XXXX account jumps instantly into 60 day late reporting mark but does not say a 30 day period was breached. I have also added proof that these bureaus are not doing a true verification and supplying relevant proof while not flippantly dismissing the FCRA mandated rules. The bureaus also refuse to provide and form of evidence there for proving their verification. The Bureaus claimed that they had verified the information, when clearly they could not have for two reasons for the BK, 1 ) it is impossible to have a bankruptcy and  have {$0.00} liabilities and {$0.00} assets reported 2 ) the bureaus claimed they verified the information, yet the source of the information sent me a letter that they do not verify information with the courts. Also, I put a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX report yet they used that agency ( NO third party can verify per FCRA ) as a third party. 

This leads me to conclude that the credit bureaus never conducted a reasonable investigation on this inaccurate information for the BK. For the Rise account they have not responded to my request for validation and verification and time has lapsed past 30 days. 

In my certified mail I also requested they remove any inquiries that are not currently associated to any account. The credit bureaus also said they verified the information but can't provide any proof. If they do have proof they have not provided that to me after many requests. 

I would like to have this inaccurate records removed from my credit report as it is reporting inaccurately and incomplete on my report.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",TX,761XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3118498

2019-01-25,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Chase Bank notifying me that an unauthorized purchase with my Chase Credit Card was made at a XXXX XXXX Store ( # XXXX ) for the amount of {$1600.00} and {$2100.00} ( a total {$3800.00} ). Then and there I realized I have lost my Credit Card. 

I immediately denied making any purchase at any XXXX XXXX Store that day. I was later informed that Chase 's Fraud Department will investigate to determine the validity of the charges. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter informing me that, after a "" thorough '' investigation, Chase 's Fraud Department determined that the transactions were valid. Thereafter, I called and spoke with the representative who was in charge of investigating my case. I was informed that because my Credit Card has a chip, and that chip was used for the purchase, then necessarily I must have been the one to  make the purchase! 

Again, I told her I did not make the purchase. Someone who wrongfully took possession of my Credit Card used the card without my authorization, and in the process of said unauthorized use, he or she must have used the chip on the card to make the transactions. How that means that I must have been the one to make the purchases is completely without basis. 

I asked her whether or not she made any attempts to obtain the video surveillance at the XXXX XXXX store in question -- because certainly it will be unequivocal proof that the purchases were made by someone other than me. To which the representative responds that I am the one who is supposed to do so. 

Right after, I attempted to contact the XXXX XXXX store in question. I was told I needed to contact their corporate office 's fraud department, to which they transferred me to. The corporate office then told me that they can not release any videos without the order number of the purchases. Of course, I certainly don't have the order number -- I was not the one to make the purchase, and, therefore, I do not have the receipt or any information as to those purchases. In fact, it's clear that XXXX XXXX was in a better position to obtain the order number than I was -- after all, it's their store and they are the ones to keep records of transactions. 

It is clear Chase 's Fraud Department did not make the alleged "" thorough '' investigation. It would appear that all the representative did was make sure that the Credit Card chip was used to make the purchase. This entire dispute revolves around the fact that someone else has possession of my card. He or she will and has undoubtedly used the Credit Card chip to make the purchase. Just because the transactions were made with the Credit Card chip in no way represents that it was made by me, especially given the circumstances that I did not have possession of the Credit Card. 

Now, in addition to this CFPB complaint, I am also filing a police report and a formal complaint with the FTC.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,941XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-01-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3133610

2019-07-13,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I applied for and received federal student loans while I was in medical school. I made every payment on time and consistently renewed my income-driven repayment plan yearly, on time and without issue. In XX/XX/XXXX, the due date on my income-driven repayment plan lapsed because I had not received an email alerting me of the yearly requirement for renewal. Upon receiving an email on XX/XX/XXXX that there was an action required on my account, I logged in to find that, because I had not submitted the income-driven plan renewal, ( 1 ) the entire outstanding interest on my loans had capitalized ( + {$19000.00} ) increasing my principal balance by ~10 % and ( 2 ) my monthly loan payment had quadrupled ( to ~ {$2100.00} ). 

I also found that I had been sent -- electronically -- one single notification on XX/XX/XXXX to renew my income-driven plan. However, the email alerting me that I had an action pending on my account was not sent. Moreover, I received no other alerts from FedLoan servicing that I needed to renew my income driven plan. Instead, on XX/XX/XXXX, the above occurred. 

I called FedLoan Servicing several times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the matter. I was forced to submit a one-time forbearance on my XX/XX/XXXX payment because it was ~ {$2100.00}, and I could not afford it. I was encouraged by a supervisor at FedLoan servicing to submit a letter explaining the above described circumstances in order to trigger an investigation and to revert the principal to its prior balance. I was told to expect a response in 2-3 months. 

It has been 6 months since my submission and despite two other calls to the company over that time period, I have not heard a response. 

I have been consistent and timely throughout the life of my loan. I have paid every payment required of me over the life of the loan and I had renewed my income-driven plan without lapse as well. This was an unfortunate event, not consistent with my prior character, that has cost me a 10 % increase in my principal balance and will cost me tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. Also, despite the costly nature forgetting to renew my income-driven plan, I only received one notification from the company to perform this task. I formally disputed the capitalization in a timely fashion ( within days of being notified, on XX/XX/XXXX ) and have not heard back.",,AES/PHEAA,CA,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-13,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3305331

The problem now is that I can not get CitiMortgage to send me copies of the monthly statements for the HELOC payments. The last statement I received was for the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX billing period. What is odd is that every other piece of mail that comes from Citi ( notices and letters from CitiMortgage regarding the HELOC - most recently, Citi 's response to my CFPB complaint - even statements from Citibank regarding inactive bank accounts ) arrives at my residence, so they clearly have the correct address. They just don't send the statements, which makes it even more difficult to stay current on payments. ( This was a recurring problem last year - I am still missing 3 out of 12 statements for XXXX - and I complained numerous times ). I spoke to a customer service person most recently on XX/XX/XXXX, who promised to email me the most recent statements, for XXXX, and to work on getting me the missing copies from XXXX. I have received nothing. I sent the attached email to XXXX XXXX, the person who contacted me regarding the earlier complaint, in the hopes she could obtain at least the XXXX statements so I could make a payment.

2019-06-28,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"This is the second time Ive been violated by Capital One in the past 2.5 years. I am praying that, as the first matter was resolved satisfactorily, I also hope this matter too can be rectified. I've been a loyal Capital One cardholder, on and off, for over 12 years. I was very surprised on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX to learn that one ( 1 ) of my active capital one credit card accounts were suddenly placed on restriction and are now in the process of being closed due to inactivity. After speaking to the customer service representative, and an escalations manager, ( XXXX in Tampa ) I was informed that because my account was closed on XXXX XXXX that attempting to have the account reopened was too far beyond the redemptive period. This was disheartening to hear considering the email I just received said the account was restricted and would be closed on XX/XX/XXXX. Meaning it was not closed yet. To add injury to insult, her telling me the account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX was the first time I had ever even heard of this. I was never alerted to anything prior to me receiving an email on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. The representative in Tampa asked for my mailing address in which I provided and said I should have received a letter stating my account was closing. To this date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I have not received anything from Capital One except for the email I received on the morning of the XX/XX/XXXX. This was really a harsh stance coming from Capital One considering that, Ive never missed a payment on any of my Capital One accounts in over 10 years, and also that I was never warned that I would be in jeopardy of losing the account due to its inactivity. If I would have been made aware beforehand, I wouldve gladly utilized this account .Not only to prevent a forced closure from occurring, but to also protect my credit profile. I am really worried how my credit is going be affected by this, as my available credit is going to be reduced significantly. Maintaining my credit rating is of utmost importance to me as some of the treatments I received are financed. Because of this, any substantial drop in credit score can affect my ability to finance my treatments/and or cost me more in interest to maintain the same level of service Ive been receiving. Closing this card could potentially create a financial hardship for me. As I think back to the previous experience I had with Capital One, although it was resolved, this created a fear within me ( of them closing my accounts ) of adding authorized users back to my cards. And by me not utilizing this option, I feel this was a precursor to me not having the activity I needed to keep this account open. I am ok with Capital One meeting their business requirements, and making account adjustments when they are required, but in my case I was never alerted to ANYTHING. I bank with other financial institutions and have encountered situations like this before in the past, but never have I been treated so harshly and unfairly, especially without recourse. After being loyal to Capital One for so long, and being a responsible cardholder, I truly hope and pray they will make an exception regarding their inactivity policy, and reconsider their actions and reopen my account.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CA,925XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-06-28,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3290690

My mortgage was put into forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX. I had damage to my home and lost employment over the storm. Once my mortgage was taken out of forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX, I was reported late to the credit bureaus. I was also reported late during forbearance and was sent to dept collection agency during forbearance. I was told that I had to pay back all the past due in one lump sum or risk foreclosure on my home. I informed my mortgage servicer that I could not pay that and requested a loan modification. It took from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX to get my loan mod complete, all in between I was reported late for 7 months on my credit reports. XXXX XXXX owns my mortgage and I opened up a claim with them. After some time, I was told by XXXX XXXX that the way this mortgage serve handled my account was incorrect. XXXX XXXX contacted my mortgage servicer and informed them that per XXXX XXXX guideline, I should not of been reported late during any of this and that the negative reporting was to be removed from my credit. This is not the case. I have filed disputes directly with the credit bureaus, and my mortgage services keeps sending over false/incorrect information when I dispute it. My family has suffered financial hardship over this, my credit is now trashed. I also suspect that this servicer has falsified their service records as now my account seems to show different information according to the customer service reps that service the account when I contact them.

A deposit of {$20.00} was made into the account on XX/XX/19. Over the weekend automatic debits and purchases with a debit card came in for XXXX {$7.00}, {$9.00}, {$12.00}, {$3.00}, clearing the bank on XX/XX/19. None of the payments were declined, and despite showing a positive balance when the check cleared, Wells Fargo assessed a {$35.00} Overdraft Charge applied on XXXX-19. I had previously disabled overdraft protection on debit card purchases when the CPFB came into existence. Wells Fargo was supposed to decline to pay the transactions at the terminal at the time of purchase. 

When I called to complain the WF Employee tried to explain to me that the debit transactions happened in such a way that they caused the overdraft fee. I insisted that I had opted out of overdraft protection on Debit Charges and the statement clearly showed there was a positive balance after the check cleared. The agent continued to argue and interrupt me. He denied that Debit Card transactions on opt out accounts were legally exempt from Overdraft Fees. I reminded them of all the fraudulent activity WF was in the news for again, and that now they were stealing from me. He agreed to waive half of the fee and stated that was all the system would allow him to do. I told him that was unacceptable for them to steal any money from me under the guise of Overdraft Charges for a check that did not bounce. He told me I would have to talk to someone higher up and I insisted he transfer me immediately. 

The next person came on the phone and the situation repeated itself, only this time he offered me an additional 15 % discount on the charges and that was all the system would allow him to do. I told him I do not care about any of your systems, this is not a negotiation I will report this to CFPB. I am not negotiating the amount of money I will allow Wells Fargo to steal from my account.

One of the conditions, was a completed divorce decree which unfortunately didn't get finalized until XX/XX/XXXX.

The problem with that is I am about {$450000.00} still under water so that is impossible, which they are fully aware of. I was told that when my mortgage was sold, my terms wouldn't change which to me at least means I am not put in a worse situation as I didn't choose them ( SPS ) they bought my loan without my consent so why should this option no longer be available to me? I feel they need to make good on the process I was going through with XXXX since it wasn't my choice to work with them they chose me.

If they were late it was never more than a couple days. I became XXXX and was granted full SS XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and caught up on any late payments in full by XXXX XXXX. However I began to fall behind again as 5 of us live off my SS. I knew that I was now in the window of repossession but had not received a formal letter as of yet only some contacts by XXXX XXXX manager ( only employee ) stating I need to call her to prevent any escalation. On XXXX, XXXX XXXX I received my SS as direct deposit. The following evening my husband went to the bank and called me in a panic that there was only {$44.00} remaining in the account and XXXX had put through 7 consecutive payments of {$180.00} totaling {$1200.00}. I contacted the bank immediately to contest the charges and notified their fraud department because I never gave authorization for ANY deductions. I called my local PD who said they could only take a report. I called the main office, after hours number and texted messages to XXXX to please call me immediately to discuss. It's been 5 days and still no communication from XXXX. They were suppose to delete my debit info. after every payment due to an unauthorized charge about a year ago. Their suggestion was to remove my payment info ( debit card number etc. ) every time I made a payment to prevent it from happening again. They shouldn't of even had my card info. let alone charge my checking account 7 times. This has put me into severe financial hardship and I am now at risk of eviction, power shut off, no car gas, no food, etc. My SS XXXX is our families only income and they took it and I can't even reach them to discuss why! I left a message that said "" you repo the car, you don't drain my checking account without permission! '' and still no response.

2019-03-05,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Please be advised that I have attempted to resolve this matter with Synchrony Bank, but the Synchrony has been non-responsive and completely ignored any attempts at providing good customer service. I am upset that Synchrony Bank took extreme measures to ruin my credit, including not contacting me regarding the one late payment that I had on my account. 
Currently, my credit report is reflecting one 30-day delinquency for XX/XX/XXXX and one 60-day delinquency for XXXX of XXXX on this account. I am not disputing the late payment in itself, but I am very upset that Synchrony would not take the time to understand my circumstances and assist me with this matter. 
I opened a XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX card in XX/XX/XXXX. I consistently made my minimum payments each month. In XX/XX/XXXX, Synchrony urged me to enroll in paperless billing and I did. I have consistently had both a monthly {$5.00} recurring charge and corresponding {$5.00} auto-draft payment take place on the account with minimal usage otherwise. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$33.00} purchase that I forgot I charged to my XXXX  XXXX account and did not increase my automatic payment to cover this purchase. Synchrony assessed multiple late payments which caused this {$33.00} purchase to grow into a {$140.00} balance. In XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my credit report and only then realized that this account was delinquent. 

Synchrony Bank has all my contact information on file ( address, phone, email ) but never contacted me regarding this past due balance. According to the Synchrony representative that I spoke to, because I was continuing to make a {$5.00} auto payment each month and was therefore making monthly payments, Synchrony had no obligation to send me a notice. 
I immediately called Synchrony customer service line and explained the situation to a supervisor named XXXX in the XXXX, OH call center. She took all my information and promised that I would receive a response within 30 business days. That call took place on XX/XX/XXXX. To this day I have not received any contact or correspondence from Synchrony replying to my inquiry. 
This has ruined my credit and caused me immense mental and physical stress. As a loyal Synchrony customer who paid her bill on time each month, I do not believe that Synchrony should continue to cause me such mental stress and ruin my credit. Lenders such as Synchrony should not be allowed to prey on unsuspecting customers, ruin their credit and then refuse to provide them with good customer service. I request that any outstanding balance be waived and this tradeline either be removed from my credit report or be updated to show as never past due.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,GA,300XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3170649

The pamphlet stated that I would have 6 months interest free on purchases and afterwards a 26.99 apr rate. This wasnt too different from my other credit cards so I naively agreed to it before reading care credits reviews. I took the offer and put {$1000.00} on credit from the vet bill. I payed the minimum monthly payment the first 6 months and expected the monthly interest afterwards to be $ 20- {$30.00}. After 6 months my payments had brought my balance down to {$810.00}. Then the FIRST statement after the 6 months were up came back with a whopping {$130.00} interest charge on purchases. Bringing my balance to {$940.00}. Almost back up to what I initially owed before payments. First of all the pamphlet said the first 6 months were interest free. So either this company was overtly lying on their advertising or charged me incorrectly.

Mr . XXXX further processed my application. During this process, and procedure all information was again verified and approved before submitting the verifications of reserves funds with the under writer department. Remember in the beginning, I was already verified for having {$1700.00} in reserves which was required, however the underwriter department requested {$30000.00}. Now this seem strange and all of sudden, I asked XXXX XXXX to have underwriter to go over their numbers again because I knew the amount was {$17000.00}, which they did. The next day, it was confirmed {$17000.00}. Well this brought red flags with me in believing they was not processing my application fairly. Then the underwriters department asked to verified my reserves which I used the information which Mr. XXXX used, my bank savings accounts, my XXXX XXXX   investment plan as well as my XXXX XXXX account. Underwriters came back and said they could not use the XXXX  account nor the XXXX XXXX account, stating they do not grant credit to any terms and conditions requested. The terms and condition they were talking about is the disclosure statement showing that I am the account Holder irregardless of others on the account and if I ever needed the funds I would be penalized for 10 % plus State and Federal Tax prematurely which would not have an affect on them just me. This is standard on any IRA, Roth, retirement savings etc. They opted for this, without stating the guidelines under XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, to justify. So I researched the Guidelines, and it stated funds that can not be withdrawn under circumstances owners retirement, employment termination, or death can not be counted as part of the borrowers reserves. Their guidelines listed whats acceptable source of reserves and Unacceptable source of reserves. In orders words the XXXX investment plan can be used and they decided on their own not to. Unacceptable. Retraining is needed here. 

Further, I have been with this company for many years and they handled two of my loans if a company, cant satisfy their customers fairly then customers dont need their servicing because of unfair practices. I hereby request an investigation into PHH mortgage Loan process particularly their underwriters department in processing refinance loans and the reserves verification.",,PHH Mortgage Services Corporation,MD,207XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-27,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3164848

The company did not complete the work and the research was done incorrectly ( supporting documents submitted to dispute dept. XX/XX/XXXX ). I filed a disput with my credit card company that I used to pay the fees, Barclay Bank of Delaware. The dispute was filed in XX/XX/XXXX. I never received correspondence advising of the results. I contacted the dispute department on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed the dispute was closed and charges of {$5500.00} had been placed back onto my account. I was informed I had the right to reopen the disputed charge. I informed the representative that I would not have the results until the issue is closed which was scheduled for late XX/XX/XXXX. She informed me shewas resend the letter via email, refused to email or fax the letter to me, she was reminded the issue would not be resolved until end of XX/XX/XXXX, which she acknowledged and stated to resubmit my dispute as soon as the issue was resolved and to fax the dispute. There was no mention of a timeline ro submit my resipute. The issue was resolved XX/XX/XXXX and documents where ready for reproduction until after XX/XX/XXXX.

We suffered through a hurricane and were given a hurricane forbearance, but XXXX lied to us about the terms of the forbearance and now we are in jeopardy of losing our home through foreclosure. We tried to apply for mortgage assistance, but XXXX is refusing to help us and say we can not afford our payments, all due to their mistake regarding how they handled the hurricane forbearance. They advised in XXXX of 2017 that they would take the amount postponed due to the forbearance and put it into the back of the loan. However, when we contacted them after the six months, we were advised that the total amount due was the six months and our regular payment. We are extremely frustrated with their process and representatives and afraid that we will lose our home through foreclosure. Also, they apparently approved us for a repayment plan and it was supposed to be mailed to us, however, we only received a request for mortgage assistance package in the mail.

2019-02-10,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am in the PSLF program with XXXX and I requested that Navient revisit my loan payment of XX/XX/2012 as they report it as short. Sallie Mae took over my Direct Loans without my approval inXX/XX/2012. In XX/XX/2012 I received a bill for {$1200.00} that did not reflect my Income Based payment plan that I was on with Direct Loans. I called to have my bill recalculated based upon my income and I was eventually told my new payment would be {$390.00}. The representative also stated my first payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX so I made my payment early on XX/XX/XXXX. The following month I received a bill for {$410.00} and paid it in full. The next month it dropped to {$400.00}. I have found out through XXXX that this payment does not count toward my 120 payments because the payment was not for the full amount. 
I can only assume the customer service representative only saw the payment for loan # XXXX and did not include Loan # XXXX. At the time I was not aware they were separate loans. I paid the amount she instructed me to. As you can verify from my payment history I have always made my loan payments in full and on time. I made my payment in good faith for the amount I was told was due. Obviously if the representative would have told me to pay an additional {$12.00} I would have done it. Unfortunately they did not provide a written statement reflecting the new amount due so I made my payment based upon their employees verbal statement of the amount due. I have submitted documents proving my case. Document 1 shows the original payment due of {$1200.00}. XXXX that did not reflect my correct IBR plan. Doc 2 clearly shows my payment of {$390.00}, no amount past due, and a XXXX payment due of {$390.00}. ( apparently this was an additional statement error that was then changed to {$410.00} ). Again I made my payment on time for the amount I was told. I should not be responsible for their billing errors. As I researched Navient online it appears this is a common practice.

I contacted Navient ( since they took over from Sallie Mae ) to try to get this issue corrected. They did not credit the payment as requested and I have included their summary as the last document. The bottom line is that I paid the amount that was requested by their agent, I paid it 2 weeks early, and when they billed me an additional amount ( above the statement amount ) the following month I paid that in full as well. Clearly I met my obligation for that to be a qualifying payment.I should not be punished for their employee 's mistake. As I am nearing the end of my PSLF program I am trying to ensure I have credit for all of my payments. With the uncertainty surrounding the program itself, every payment is crucial before the program ends so I really would appreciate your assistance in resolving this as soon as possible. I can be reached at ( XXXX ) XXXX or via email at XXXX.

2019-01-29,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"PenFed ( Pentagon Federal ) Credit Union keeps transferring money back from my checking account to my savings account so that every single time I do a bill pay, the check that is supposed to go to the payee ends up BOUNCING!

They are not ONLY defrauding me, but had been engaging in systematically harassing me through these fraudulent transactions where they bounce checks that I issue from my checking account through bill pay ON PURPOSE.

Before I do any bill pay, I MAKE SURE that I have enough money from my checking account to cover the amount of check I am writing.

As soon as I have issued a bill pay check from my check account, PenFed EITHER closes my checking account OR transfers the money back from my checking account to my savings account WITHOUT MY CONSENT AND KNOWLEDGE!

This has happened TWICE already, and they are doing this to force me to close my accounts with them, not to mention contributing to my unnecessary stress and greatly affecting my state of mind.

Thus, PenFed is committing fraud on my behalf by intentionally and knowingly making it look like I am bouncing checks when I AM NOT, not to mention cruelly and consistently harassing me.

They are also prolonging transactions on purpose so that they can control how long I keep my accounts open instead of me doing that!

There was also a time that one of the member representatives told us ( family member and I ) over the phone that we would have to go back to Texas to deal with this account in a satisfactory manner.

No travel to where the account was opened, no satisfactory resolution was what this PenFed employee indicated.

This was news to me, as the last time I had seen that bill 's balance it was submitted to XXXX for payment under their auto policy claims department, and they hadn't informed me it was paid or not.

The XXXX XXXX representative said she would quote "" do everything she could to have it removed. '' Well, it has not been removed per our discussion, and my disputes about the improper billing procedure have been initiated with Experian. This is why I am writing to complain, because Experian has all the information they need to remove this account. They know that I did not know of its existence until it was observed on my Experian. They know that XXXX XXXX improperly submitted bills to an address that I did not live at. They know that I had an agreement for this account to be removed. They know I have not been late on any payments, EVER, and yet this account remains. I have disputed it multiple times. Each time Experian waits a day and then takes no action, and just marking the dispute as completed without removing the account. It hasn't been properly handled. It should be removed. My theory is that no one at Experian has read or understood the content of my communications, and that no one at XXXX XXXX has bothered to keep our agreement to remove after I held up my end of the bargain and paid in full. In conclusion this account should never have been in collections.

This is especially true as all these small accounts and payments to them where handled by my wife and I don't know those details off the top of my head, and she isn't around.

I contacted Equifax 3x and every time I am told to contact the creditors which I have done to no avail. It is a never ending cycle of being told the same thing over and over again to no avail. It has affected me personally and I intend to pursue litigation and hold Equifax liable as they have offered me no recourse. If the inquiries are a "" matter of fact '' and the companies were doing account reviews they should be coded as "" soft '' not hard inquiries. Under no circumstances are unauthorized "" hard inquiries '' allowed to remain a fact of record. Equifax continues to tell me that and that is not true. I have attached the letter of the unauthorized inquires which has been previously sent to Equifax which they have completely ignored. You are told to contact the creditor over and over again and they know that gets no results. If the inquiries are fraudulent, then of course the companies have documentation because they think you authorized it. That does not mean its authorized. Additionally, several companies indicated they were account reviews. If they were account reviews then they should be coded as such. The companies then lie and say they will contact Equifax to remove it or code it as soft but it never happens. This has been going back and forth far too long. I will absolutely take legal action if Equifax ignores my 4th request to remove or correct inaccurate information. If the creditors have been negligent in correcting this information Equifax has a duty to remove it or correct it. This is becoming a little ridiculous.

I would like to make the CFPB aware of this occurrence as I never received a formal document from XXXX/XXXX XXXX notifying me of the possibility of a default judgment or documentation demonstrating the suit that was filed in the XXXX Municipal/Circuit Court for period XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

I would like be contacted by a representative of either/or both XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX via phone or email in order to facilitate a mutually beneficial payment arrangement as I would like to avoid a potential default judgment as I do not have any available PTO to attend the legal proceeding scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX and also do not have additional funds available to pay for legal representation. 

Latest updates are that I never received a letter from Hayt Hayt and Landau regarding in XXXX as referenced in XXXX letter of response ( attached ) to my initial request to create a payment arrangement which was submitted through CFPB - and if I had not been contacted by an outside legal entity that I would not be aware that a court case was entered against my name. As a result of this discovery I have repeatedly reached out to Hayt Hayt Landau and have left voicemail messages with XXXX XXXX and also physically spoken to a team member that promised they would have the attorney on the case call me back or email me on XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I still have not received a call/ voicemail message or an email in response to my request to create a payment arrangement. As I have not been given a file number yet due to no one reaching out to me - I am unable to establish a payment arrangement or initiate a payment. Can someone please advise me on whether I should initiate a payment arrangement with XXXX if Hayt Hayt Landau does not contact me via email/phone or respond to my phone calls prior to the XX/XX/XXXX court date? I do not have vacation/leave available to go to court or additional money available for legal representation and would like to establish and arrangement in order to resolve this issue. If I am unable to resolve this issue a judgment would put me into an even more arduous financial situation. I will continue to call Hayt Hayt Landau as I would like to establish an arrangement as soon as possible.

Now, it is XX/XX/XXXX more than one month later. I still did not receive any check. I called them this afternoon, and the customer service said since they still could not verify my identity, so they would not return the funds!!! They would keep them because they thought I was not who I am!!! That is just totally ridiculous! I just need them to mail a check to the address on file. I do not know why they refused. I opened the account with that address, received the check book and debit card with that same address. They never doubt that address is not belonged to me. Now when I ask them to return a check to the same address, they think I am illegal. They doubt I am not myself. The address is on my credit file and the file related to my driver license. All the documents I provided are totally legal and real! 

When I open the account, they never doubt my identity. When they mailed me the materials including the checkbook and debit card, they never doubt my identity. After there were money in the account, they began to doubt my identity. At first, I trust them completely and provide all documents they required. I did everything I could, but right now, it seems they were cheating. I doubt this bank was using customer 's money to do their business.

2019-04-24,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the XXXX, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the  requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,333XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-04-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3221368

2018-12-19,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"","I currently have a LTV of 78.00 % on my current home mortgage. I have requested the private mortgage insurance to be cancelled. The loan servicer, ( Chase Home Mortgage ), the PMI company ( XXXX XXXX ) and the loan holder ( XXXX XXXX ) are requiring me to get a BPO ( Brokers Price Opinion ) which costs {$100.00} for determination that my house has not decreased in value. 

Per the HPA ( Homeowners Protection Act ), when a homes LTV reaches 78 % of the original mortgage amount the loan servicer has to request the PMI be cancelled. Chase Mortgage will not request the PMI to be cancelled unless a BPO is obtained. I am being penalized by paying extra on my mortgage to get the PMI cancelled earlier than the predicted amoritization date of when my LTV would be 80 % which was predicted to be XX/XX/XXXX. 

Furthermore, if i had not been forward thinking and not checked on this my PMI would have been automatically canceled in XX/XX/XXXX, however my LTV would have most likely been around 70 % at that point. I would not have received a refund on the PMI that was not required to be paid based on I reached a LTV of 78 % in XX/XX/XXXX.

2019-07-04,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,330XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-04,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3296165

VERFIFY PROPERLY BOTH the VALIDITY OF and PERFECT CERTIFIED COMPLIANT REPORTING OF all claim ( s ) and every aspect of claim ( s ) OR ELSE permanently REMOVE THE FOLLOWING DATA/ACCOUNTS and or the undocumented derogatory aspects of such data/accounts : REBUTTAL NOTATION : Accuser has failed to provide any evidence of either the injurious derogatory claim 's verifiable validity NOR any documented certification of compliance as reporting, each mandatory condition to report so DELETE NOW! Item is mine YET is NOT proven COMPLIANT in its reporting. As reported, Item is mine YET is NOT LEGALLY REPORTABLE due to being one or more of untrue, erroneous, incomplete, unverifiable, invalid, or else wise NOT proven COMPLIANT in its reporting. Per My states reporting laws and the applicable federal standards of lawful reporting, ANY REPORTED ALLEGATION of delinquency and or derogatory of injury against a consumer MUST be documented as TRUE, CORRECT, COMPLETE, TIMELY, of accused consumers ownership and responsibility, fully valid, and irrefutably verifiable as such. ADDITIONALLY, even if true and valid, any claim of derogatory and injurious nature MUST BE REPORTED IN FULL COMPLIANCE, even to the mandatory true correct and complete XXXX XXXX FORMAT REPORTING COMPLIANCE and further be testimonial and CERTIFID AS being so or else claim ( s ) must be vacated permanently and immediately! DELETE NOW to be COMPLIANT!

Should this item of alleged account ( or account aspects ) of a reported delinquency and or derogatory condition be related to any alleged inquiry ( ies ) still yet unproven to hold the minimum mandatory document proof ( s ) thereby absolutely validating the physically verifiable written evidence of adequately achieved permissible purpose I demand that you immediately act to eradicate the accusations as unfounded and not currently compliant in its reporting, as is REQUIRED to report! Surely if unable to present undeniable physically verifiable proof of an items alleged delinquency ( ies ) and or derogatory ( ies ) as reported there exists ( LOGICALLY ) a concern and reasonable doubt as related to any linked allegation ( s ) of inquiry ( ies ) thereof as well! PLEASE WORK to Ensure the ethical, moral, adequately accurate, fully compliant reporting by your immediate willful modification ( s ) and or removals from reporting of any item or aspect of item ( s ), INCLUDING CLAIMS OF INQUIRY, that yet fail to meet the demonstrated requisites as mandatory, mentioned or not!

Notation : Please verify and validate all claims, every notation, dates and balances, whether reported or not. Remove immediately the unverified therefore invalidly reported CHARGE OFF claim. To date, no document proof of the physically verifiable validity of claim has been demonstrated nor offered. I am concerned with the reported data, please detail factually all aspects of claim, every notation, all dates and balances, source codes and personal identifiers, full 426-character P-segment with trailing factors, creditor classification code, XXXX, the 386-pieces to confirmate collection, and all requisite framents of reporting, mentioned or not.

Notation : Remove immediately the unverified therefore invalidly reported DEROGATORY CLAIM. The information reporting is one or more of being untrue, incorrect, incomplete, of not my ownership, of not my responsibility, not reported compliantly, or else wise is invalid deficient of physically verifiable document evidence of facts. Please verify and validate all claims, every notation, dates and balances, whether reported or not.

Notation : Remove immediately the unverified therefore invalidly reported claim that is significantly DEFICIENT REPORTED DATA. The information reporting is one or more of being untrue, incorrect, incomplete, of not my ownership, of not my responsibility, not reported compliantly, or else wise is invalid deficient of physically verifiable document evidence of facts. Please verify and validate all claims, every notation, dates and balances, whether reported or not. I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to- be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into a open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,301XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3148559

We have our payments automatically drafted out of our accounts and in XXXX I received a text that we are behind on payments which confused me because all payments were drafted automatically. I immediately called Mr. Cooper to find our what was going on and what was a balloon. The explanation given that is what we signed up for it 15 years ago. First of all, once a balloon was explained to us, we would have never agreed to pay in full what was left on the loan. No way would we ever agree to pay {$17000.00} in one payment. I asked them why I wasn't mailed a letter or notified this was going to happen the first XXXX. Mr. Cooper stated that they sent emails and listed on our account.

We didn't receive any communication on the smaller loan until I received a text saying we are delinquent on our loan payment and to call. That's when I called and found out we had a balloon loan and what it was. They told there is nothing they can do except sell my home and use the equity to pay off the loan. I shred with them that's not an option. I asked if there was way to continue to pay as we have been for the past 15 years and they said no.

I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. 

Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community.

I received a summons from an attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXdated XX/XX/XXXX This summons was given to Debt counseling agency and they are working with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo ignored the debt counseling agency 's negotiations and not willing to work with the debt counseling agency so in turn they garnished my ENTIRE paycheck including my wife 's. 

XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo garnished my ENTIRE paycheck and also my wife 's paycheck and left us with {$1000.00} to live on. I have a house mortgage, utilities, food that I am not able to meet to survive and now in financial hardship. They went into our checking account and savings account and took a total of {$2600.00} all in one chunk. Wells Fargo did not notify us that this will happen and ignored the debt counseling agency 's negotiation.. 

I am in utter emotional distress that Wells Fargo was able to do this when we are in a debt counseling agency and willing to pay Wells Fargo for my debt incurred. Wells Fargo jumped the gun, was greedy and just wanted to take the money without regard for the consumer and their personal living expenses. 

According to the garnishment law, they are suppose to only take no more than 25 % of the paycheck and not entitled to take the ENTIRE PAYCHECK and my wife 's too. Because we have a joint bank account they helped themselves and stole all our money. 

It is criminal Wells Fargo Bank would help themselves to our bank account. I will no longer bank with them since I know they are under criminal investigations for other bank fraud. I also checked my account and now they charged me for hidden charges which leaves my account at a negative balance.

We have more than enough cash in our escrow account, there is no reason why they shouldn't be paying our tax bills on time. Our tax bill this quarter was due on XX/XX/XXXX. We reached out to them first on XX/XX/XXXX and asked them to pay, then again on XX/XX/XXXX when we received the tax sale notice. The assured me they would and would send the check overnight. We get a call today saying they sent the check via regular mail on XX/XX/XXXX and could not confirm it was paid.

The amount was {$12000.00}. 

Despite contacting the bank via telephone and spending over an hour on the phone with them ( being passed from department to department ), the bank refused to authorise my payment. After many different attempts at rectifying the issue by several different departments, the bank finally told me that a {$5000.00} daily transaction limit ( that I had previously neither agreed upon or knew about ), could not be waived even with my authorisation. The call centre also gave poor instruction to the dealership on how to authorise the transaction as debit, which led to a {$3000.00} transaction going through as credit ( giving the dealership a financial penalty which luckily they accepted on my behalf ). The bank then tried to force me to do a wire transfer, and didn't tell me there would be a charge until I was just about to authorise the transaction. Luckily I did not complete the transaction. 

I was forced to leave the dealership and complete a 2 hour round trip to retrieve a check book from home.

Upon examination of the report, I noticed that there were some inaccurate items that should not be there. 

After sending certified, return receipt letters on XX/XX/18 ( which were received on XX/XX/18 ), reporting that there were inaccuracies on my credit report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, account # : XXXX, claiming that I owe {$8100.00}, I requested that I would like some type of verification bearing my signature. I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. 

Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community. Since no verification of any kind has ever been sent to me or provided, I am seeking that this particular inaccurate claim is removed immediately.

XXXX  was very easy to work with always had the most accurate information. Information regarding the number of qualifying payments was available and up to date on their website. In XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were taken over and transferred by XXXX XXXX without my request, approval or knowledge. I found out this occurred the next time I contacted XXXX. Since I am nearing retirement age, I am always checking to see what the status is of my "" qualifying months ''. Every year I submit a new Employment Verification form as advised by the Department of Education. I contacted XXXX XXXX to request this information and they have NEVER been able to tell me what the number of qualifying months is. The employees who are supposed to provide customer service are anything but. They have an attitude and skirt around every question or request for information I present to them. The ONLY place you can find the qualifying number of payments is on the statement. However, the number of qualifying months KEEPS CHANGING going up and down, mostly going down and my student loan balance keeps going up. They aslo tell me they can not verify any of the payments made to XXXX  yet my account was transferred to XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted them because the XX/XX/XXXX Statement shows only 12 qualifying payments, however, the XX/XX/XXXX statement shows 32 qualifying payments. I thought perhaps there was an error in adding the newly approved payments from the recently submitted Employment Certification Form to the already identified 32 qualifying payments. I was told that since I requested an audit on my account ALL the payments had to be re-verified. This process has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX and they could not tell me how long it would take. I asked to speak to a manager and was basically told that's they way they do things, would not provide me any policy stating the process, did not offer to expedite the process and said this could cause my qualifying payments to do down. Now how hard is it to qualify the payments each year and then add the new qualifying payments each year they receive an Employment Certification form. It is very disenchanting when the qualifying payments becomes a moving target. I am unable to plan for my retirement not knowing how many more years I have to work so my loan will be forgiven. In the meantime, my balance keeps going up and if my qualifying payments are one short, I will owe the entire amount irregardless of what I have been paying since XX/XX/XXXX.",,AES/PHEAA,FL,335XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,2019-01-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3121964

My account was closed for no reason. 

I went to check my account online only to find out that it had been closed. I tried to contact the company on this day only to find out that my account online had been suspended. Also I tried phone contact and the automated system is telling me the same thing and would not process my call for me to speak with a customer service rep. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I finally was able to get through and spoke with XXXX ( Supervisor in the Acct. Protection Services ). XXXX stated that the account had been suspended for fraudulent activity and that it was being looked into. I would be notified via email. I never received any type correspondance from Amex/Bluebird in regards to my acct. Every customer rep that I spoke with this day is telling me the same thing. 

So on XX/XX/XXXX, I called again and explained my situation to a customer service rep. Who responded with the same info as the call on XX/XX/XXXX. Now I ask to speak with another Supervisor. I speak with XXXX ( Acct. Protection Servicces ). XXXX says my account is still being investigated. It takes 7-10 business days. She went further on to say that {$28.00} was being sent back to sender ( XXXX XXXX ) & the balance of $ XXXX-a direct deposit transaction will be refunded via a check. Again 7-10 business days. Still no correspondance from AMex as to why the account was closed and when/where my money is, What transactions were fraud. nothing. 

i given plenty of time for some type of letter, something to be sent to me. I had a balance of {$66.00} left on the acct. It wasn't returned to sender and I have not received my funds back. These funds had been sitting on the account why wasn't it flagged upon deposit. Which by the way was from a legit bank account. 

Today XX/XX/19 I call the company again demanding an answer as to where my money is. I again speak with a customer service rep. who by the way had me on hold for like 15 min. only for her to tell me the same as previous, and that I would need to write the company. I then speak with XXXX ( supervisor ). She also had me on hold for like 15min. Today this whole call started @ XXXX and went on 42 minutes. Being put on hold multiple times only for XXXX to come back and tell me that I need to write the company @ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX. Also that I will not be getting my money refunded to me for fraud. 

WHY AND WHERE IS MY MONEY. IM TIRED OF THE RUN AROUND. All I want is my money back. You can't just take my balance on my card, close the account and not say nothing to the customer. It's bad enough if you send me a check I have to pay to cash the check for my own money.

Unfortunately, that payment went to the wrong person. The number had one of the digits wrong and was received by the wrong person. I made the transaction before XXXX XXXX and didn't find out until later that evening. The person that was supposed to get the money called me asking if I sent the money. That's when I realized the money was linked to the wrong person on accident. At that moment I was fine and called customer service right away. When I called, the lady I spoke to said that it was too late to reverse the claim. They transferred me to the fraud department to start a claim. The person I spoke to at the fraud department basically told me that the only way for me to get it was by having that person return my money back. To me, that sounded absurd so I asked how come they wouldn't do that instead of asking me to do it myself. The lady basically said they will try within 45 calendar days. At that point I freaked out so I decided to call the lady after I was done speaking to the fraud department. After numerous attempts and dialing from different numbers, the lady finally answered. When I spoke to her she kept saying that I was trying to scam her. She also stated that such money was already gone from her account and she also wanted to speak to her family to she how she should proceed with this. I was on the phone with her for over 30 minutes, explaining to her and asking her to please send it back to me. Once I mentioned law enforcement, she hung up and never answered her phone again. I tried to file a police report after that call and they basically said they couldn't do it because she wasn't doing anything illegal. I explained that she knows that money isn't hers and she's still not giving it back so that's pretty much stealing knowingly. They denied me the police report and at this point I'm blown away. I kept calling customer service to check on the status of my claim and they kept on telling me to wait, that I would receive a letter in the mail. Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, my account was credited and refunded. I was happy but that happiness didn't last long enough. The following day the money was taken away again and was told that my money was gone and that they weren't able to get the money back from that person 's bank account and I had to pay for it.

2019-01-30,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am formally writing this letter of complaint to you in regard to Equifax Credit Bureau. 

Equifax has violated FCRA rules and consistently failed to delete several inaccurate, unverifiable, adverse and erroneous accounts that they posted on my credit report. These inaccurate accounts are as follows : XXXX ( account # XXXX  ) in the amount of {$570.00} and XXXX ( account # XXXX  ) in the amount of {$570.00} and XXXX ( account # XXXX  ) in the amount of {$190.00}. 

Under the laws of the FDCPA, I have contacted the collection agency myself and have been unable to get them to verify that this is indeed my debt. I also will enclose the lettered copies of my communication to XXXX. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), Equifax is required by federal law to verify - through the physical verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts they post on a consumer credit report. Ill enclose the copies of several letters ( with certified mailed receipts ) that I sent to Equifax in request to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) for the adverse the accounts they continue to post on my credit report. I have suffered extensive grief and emotional distress due to Equifaxs failure to accurately verify these accounts, resulting in my inability to obtain credit. I have also advised Equifax that according to Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA they are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. 

Equifax was also furnished proof that the XXXX ( account # xxxxxxxx ) in the amount of {$190.00} was in fact disputed and DELETED from my credit report by XXXX  and XXXX  SINCE XX/XX/2018 ; ( I will re submit the proof of deletions via attachment ). However, Equifax continues to carelessly and negligently continue to post that inaccurate account ( {$190.00} ) to my credit report!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

In the absence of such documentation ( an original Consumer Contract ) bearing my signature, I formally request Equifax immediately delete all the aforementioned derogatory accounts from my credit report associated under my Social Security number. I will litigate if this request is not honored. 

Note : This CFPB complaint is solely directed to Equifax Credit Bureau.

Upon examination of the report, I noticed that there were some inaccurate items that should not be there. 

After sending certified, return receipt letters on XX/XX/18 ( which were received on XX/XX/18 ), reporting that there were inaccuracies on my credit report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, account # : XXXX, claiming that I owe {$940.00}, I requested that I would like some type of verification bearing my signature to verify the debt. I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. 

Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community. Since no verification of any kind has ever been sent to me or provided, I am seeking that this particular inaccurate claim is removed immediately.

I could see the report only for the few minutes it remained open in my browser. 

On Tuesday, 2019XXXX, I attempted to get my annual free credit report from Experian.com. Starting from XXXX, I was able to open the report in my browser ( XXXX XXXX  ). 

But when I attempted to print the report for my records, I found it was in an extremely condensed format. Only summary data printed. 

By clicking a large number of pale, hard-to-spot icons, I was able to open detail sections of the report. But the details were displayed using colored icons that disappeared when I attempted to print them. Only blank white space appeared. 

Nowhere on the page could I find a link for a printable or downloadable version of the report. I tried several ways of saving the web page itself, but none of them preserved the report data. 

While I was attempting to find a way to successfully save or print the data, my browser reported, "" For security reasons, your session has expired. '' The report vanished from my screen. 

In summary, Experian provided me a report that could not be printed or saved, that I could only view for a short time before it was erased from my browser. Such behavior might satisfy the letter of the FCRA, but can hardly satisfy its spirit. 

I've not had such problems in the past with XXXX or XXXX reports.

In XX/XX/XXXX I took a permanent job with the XXXX of the XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

In XXXX XXXX I consolidated my federal loans, entered into a income-based repayment plan, and enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. 

I have stayed permanently employed with the XXXX of the XXXX ever since and am still employed at XXXX. 

Every year I submit my employer certification, my taxes, and my income-based repayment plan recalculation. 

I have taken 15 months of deferments since XXXX. That means I have made 89 payments ( of my 120 payments ) since enrolling in the PSLF program. 

My loan has been sold a couple of times and FedLoan Servicing took it over in about XX/XX/XXXX. FedLoan Servicing now says that I have only made 68 qualifying payments and they do not have a record of payments made prior to XX/XX/XXXX. They are conducting an audit but told me they could not say when it would be completed and it may take 6 months or longer. My bank says that the only way they can pull bank statements that far back is if I pay a fee of {$35.00} per hour of research and {$5.00} per bank statement and that the research may be extensive because the records are on microfiche. 

I believe that FedLoan Servicing is not counting the qualifying payments I made between XXXX and XXXX and are shorting me by about 21 payments ( over {$10000.00} ) and that this will incorrectly extend my PSLF repayment period and may interfere with the ultimate forgiveness of my loans.

SPS statements they mailed to me indicates that I owe XXXX XXXX dollars ( XXXX ) for property taxes, which is not true but they refused to tell me how they derived at that number. There are also charges that show XXXX charges for inspections with no details as to why, especially since I was not in foreclosure. I sent SPS a payment history to show that the billing was incorrect however they refused to stop the Auction of my home scheduled for XX/XX/2019. I filed a Notice of Error on XX/XX/2019 they have ignored the notice, even though they have opened an inquiry for research. They indicated they did not have to stop it because of the RESPA regulations did not apply to Dual Tracking for this incident. The notice of error stated numerous accounting errors by SPS, over charges and other erroneous charges from companies that I do not know that are on the SPS statement of charges sent out by the previous servicer and SPS. 

I also was charged for numerous inspections charges for my home when my home was not in foreclosure. I was charged BPO charges and legal fees when my account was in a current status. I am not sure of what the charges are that are on my account and why, but I asked that SPS give  an accounting to why they continued to charge those incorrect amounts to my mortgage account when I have indicated they were incorrect many times. They are currently ignoring my request. I requested that SPS review my account and make corrections to my interest and my principle, they have refused to this date to do that. 
SPS on XX/XX/XXXX received a QWR they have refused to respond to my request, they indicated they will respond to it after my home is auctioned off which does not make a lot of sense to me. SPS has given erroneous information about the status of my account, I was told by several managers especially one that opened the research to verify the accounting errors on my account that the auction of my home would be postponed until that happened. Of course that was lies. I have requested several call backs from supervisor in the department of the Ombudsman and litigations no one will return the call. I requested that other executives in SPS ( any department ) return the call and address my inquiries and there has been no response, no call back and no evidence that they are willing to allow a workout plan. This has been blatant bullying and harassment from SPS with refusal to discuss with me the status of my account. 

The interest on my account is incorrect because of the erroneous charges therefore the principle is incorrect I have as for a pay-off and settlement which they withdrew which was a breach of the prior agreement in place. I have charges on my account for forced place insurance that need to be corrected and adjusted on my account.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",KY,402XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-06-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3278843

2019-07-25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","Back in XXXX of XXXX I called Ocwen who is my mortgage lender because I was behind on my payments. The representative I spoke to suggested that I do a loan modification. I told him I would like to try that so he was sending me the paperwork. I asked him that if in the meantime I should bring my mortgage current because I could borrow the money from someone I knew. He said yes go ahead and do that. When I got the paperwork I gathered all the documents filled out the paperwork and sent it in. It came back denied, when I asked them if they could tell me why I was denied they told me that it was because I was not behind on my payments! I was angry because that person I knew that if I became current I would not qualify. Their response was that they always encourage people to make their payments! So I continue to struggle making my payments. And in XXXX of XXXX I was behind again. I had a law firm that was contacting me that told me they could help me get my payments 2 less than {$700.00} a month. I had my income tax return so I could have brought my mortgage current but the law firm told me not to because they would have to start their process I'm getting a new loan modification for me all over. That ended up being a disaster because they claim they did not know about a deferred amount on my mortgage and I ended up with a loan modification the changed my monthly payment from {$1000.00} a month to {$1500.00} a month. That was finalized and I started making those payments around XXXX of XXXX. I fell behind again and when I try to make a partial payment at the beginning of XXXX of XXXX the website told me that I needed to make a payment of {$5000.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. I proceeded to gather the money and a week before that date I called to find out if I could just make the payment over the phone. The representative I spoke to said I could do that. I asked him if it would withdraw that very same day because I had money going in that day and I wanted to make sure that the money was in there before the withdrawal came out. He told me that I could make the payment the following week and if that would be okay. So he said he would make a notation in my file that I was going to make the payment on XX/XX/XXXX of {$5000.00} over the phone. When XX/XX/XXXX came and I called to make the payment they said I could not make the payment. They told me I had to call a law firm and talk to someone named XXXX. When I called the number they gave me there was no one named XXXX working there but the woman told me that I was speaking to that she could help me. She said that she could get me a new reinstatement quote an email it to me within 3 days. When I received that quote it was for {$7400.00} because there were lawyer fees attached as well and the date I had to come up with that by was XX/XX/XXXX. I do not understand how a company can just tell people whatever they want and not honor the agreements they make. There is something very wrong with all of this and I believe that I have been treated very unfairly.",,Ocwen Financial Corporation,MN,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3318639

The departments they were from was Account Managers and Account Opening Specialists continuing to bounce myself back and forth. I am trying to figure out if my husband and i are permanently blacklisted from ever having another Discover card again. 

My husband and I both had Discover cards in XXXX which were closed back in XX/XX/XXXX if i recall correctly, by Discover. Per a rep i was advised our accounts are marked as "" Revoked/Closed. '' My husband has a XXXX balance with 100 % payments with Discover. Only remark is "" Account closed by XXXX XXXX. '' I am in a similar boat only difference is i am still paying my balance off but 100 % payments made with every lender including Discover.

Any time one of us tries to apply with Discover or attempts a Pre-Qualification we receive the same denial reason "" Unable to offer due to existing or prior relationship with Discover. '' I have spoken to quite a few reps and spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out an answer but can't receive a definitive answer. Are we both blacklisted from Discover now because our accounts were closed by Discover? One rep suggested applying in 7 years since thats when bad remarks fall of credit reports. However our Discover accounts never went to collections, never missed payments, weren't charged off. Just closed and either paid off or currently paying off. I called again and asked how long Discover keeps the "" Revoked/Closed '' Status in their system and was advised its permanent. Essentially my understanding is we will never be able to obtain a Discover card again if i am understanding correctly.",,DISCOVER BANK,MN,550XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3161539

Significant Dates : ( D.1 ) XX/XX/XXXX : we received a bill from TMS with a significant change in our monthly amount due. My spouse contacted TMS ( XXXX ) to inquiry what changed. We discovered that there were discrepancies in the escrow account and that TMS would investigate. 
( D.2 ) XX/XX/XXXX : TMS ( XXXX ) contacted my spouse to inform us that our real estate tax wasnt entered correctly, and so TMS paid the bill. TMS then unilaterally developed a payment plan over 12 months which would increase our monthly payment by approximately $ 800/month. Paraphrasing from TMS ( XXXX ), TMS paid the bill, so you will be paying TMS back and now paying the correct payments towards escrow on future billing cycles. We explained that the significant change in monthly billing cycles is still unacceptable due to the significant financial hardship it would cause and that we should not be penalized for their error. TMS ( XXXX ) stated that she understood our concern and that the matter would be looked at further by TMS and someone would call us back. 
( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : Because no representatives from TMS had contacted us, my spouse called them to inquire what other options were available. Eventually, a supervisor/lead ( XXXX ) was placed in touch with my spouse. Paraphrasing TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) information was entered incorrectly, but we have to pay for the XXXX their ) deficiency. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then recommended that our insurance be lowered to decrease monthly bill cycles to compensate for the high monthly payment. Due to my status as active component military TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) also recommended that we pursue local tax exclusions/benefits to limit our monthly payments. Because of my spouses concern that our conflict was not being resolved, she asked for TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) to contact me ( primary borrower on account ). 
( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX : TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) contacts primary borrower via voicemail as requested, but fails to leave an extension number to be reached. I was on hold for approximately 38 minutes before being routed to an operator/customer care representative and then placed on hold for another approximate five minutes to contact the TMS Supervisor. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) apologized for the delay and failure to provide adequate contact information beyond I am the only ( XXXX ) in the department and one of four team leads. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then explained to the me ( primary borrower ) that the property taxes was not entered or calculated correctly, and that the responsibility rests with the borrower. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) then again recommended that I adjust my insurance to compensate for the error, however, I see this as an inappropriate/unauthorized person directing what risks I should take as both an owner and borrower. He further recommended that I ask local authorities for exemptions due to my military status. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) offered to extend the re-payment to 24 or possibly 36 months to compensate for the escrow shortfall. I ( primary borrower ) requested additional documentation from TMS due to my concern about how, where, and why my payments were being used. I also stated that in my lay knowledge, I understood and considered TMS to be in multiple violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RSPCA ), especially in consideration of potentially improperly applying or crediting payments, neglecting to pay taxes, and failing to provide information on workout options. Additionally, I stated to TMS Supervisor that I may write a formal notice of error in accordance with the RSPCA and file a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if my lay research into the issue indicated that was appropriate to do so. TMS Supervisor ( XXXX ) explained that he understood, was sorry, and indicated that the mistake may have been TMS. Although the TMS Supervisor ( XXXXt ) was courteous and polite on the phone, I do not feel that he is/was enabled to remedy the problem in a manner that I feel is reasonable. 

Other concerns noted leading to decision to file complaint : ( C.1 ) TMS stated to spouse that they did not know they were responsible for property taxes or amount, but they had previously paid it. 
( C.2 ) Escrow account appears to be at a zero balance since the beginning of XXXX, but no notice was given to the borrower until a spike of monthly payments was encountered. 
( C.3 ) Escrow disbursements appear to be erratic.

( C.4 ) Length of time observed to review our account seems longer than necessary, which has placed consumer into danger of being significantly overdue on the account while the discrepancies are identified and rectified ( XXXX ) Following the XX/XX/XXXX escrow analysis, borrower paid minimum amount billed ( {$1800.00} ) or more for each billing cycle. Borrower was moderately delinquent on payment only once during the lifecycle of the mortgage, which was rectified once borrower was made away of a banking/funds error during a XXXX season. This delinquency was not significant enough to incur a late payment fee. 
( C.6 ) After researching similar complaints regarding TMS on the Consumer Complaint Database of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau , the borrower is concerned that this may be a trend for TMS ( example : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ).",,"MONEY SOURCE, THE",LA,701XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-28,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3165222

Leaving me a balance of XXXX with them that posted on Friday XX/XX/2019 Saturday the XXXX I try to add my bank. Had to wait till Monday the XXXX for approval.They rejected it because they said the names don't match. Bank had my middle initial and my account with them don't. But later I found out both accounts had my full name. So I requested a wire transfer. They said it would go though by XXXX. Monday night I call and see what happened. They said there not sure to call back tomorrow. Tuesday XXXX at XXXX I call and they said everything is good .and at XXXX I call and check they said it didn't process because the bank I was wiring it to was on there blacklist. XXXX Bank. So I gave them another bank. Called back at XXXX. And they said it didnt process because the XXXX was wrong. Which it wasn't. So I sent in 2 more bank accounts. They said it would be tomorrow before it processes. Wednesday at XXXX and they said that the transfer is on hold and the rep on the phone refused to give me a reason why. Said someone will email me and let me know. Wednesday night still no word from ally. So I login in to my account and was able to electronically link one of my other banks. So I tried to do a ACH transfer and it gave me a error and said for me to call them so. I called. The rep. Did not know why it gave a error said my wire transfer is on hold did not know why. So I told him to cancel the wire and do a ACH to my bank that i just added for {$600.00} so he said ok and he put the request though. A few hours pass so I. check my account still no request on my account dashboard and on there website under FAQ its says to check the status online transfer to go look under activity. I look and still nothing So I go and do the request online and it accepted the request and waiting for approval. So today Thursday at XXXX I check my account and the request was rejected. I check my email and said that it was rejected because the ACH profile to that my linked bank account was dead. So i call again. And the rep XXXX XXXX out said that I wasn't getting my money today. And didn't give me a reason. Just wanted to know why I wanted to withdraw my money. Now my account is on restriction. Said I have to wait 10 days before I can withdraw. I asked him why my account dash board has my balance amount under the field line of cash available for with draw today. But you telling me it's not. He said that statement doesn't mean anything. It's just there. And then asked me if I wanted to do a stock trade or buy stock. I told him no he acted like I was breaking up and then hung up the phone. So at XXXX on XX/XX/2019 I log into the app to do a trade and says my account is not available for trade. So I call them again and ask why can't I trade he said because I have a pending with draw. I asked what withdraw because I thought all was rejected or canceled. He said you still have the {$600.00} ACH withdraw request to my linked bank account that the rep put in over the phone.. but that request is on hold and my account is restricted because of all the multiable request of withdraws. The thing that gets me is that the ACH withdraw that I put in online was rejected because the ACH profile was dead. If that's true then the ACH withdraw that the rep put in should have the same error. Because it's the same liked bank account. That they said the profile was dead on. But yet the transfer is on hold. Just does not make any since. 

I'm so sick of banks keeping my money from me. 

Please let me know how I should proceed.

2019-04-25,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Public record information inaccurate,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s )  inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",,LEXISNEXIS,OH,440XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-04-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3222219

Several hours later I was at the XXXX Dealership with the General Manager finalizing the transaction and called USAA Banking back to verify the Interest Rate and was told my rate would be 4.28 percent on borrowing {>= $1,000,000}. During this same call the USAA Representative was even nice enough to verify the monthly loan payments in terms of how much of a down payment I was going to make on the purchase. The following Tuesday XX/XX/2019 I recontacted USAA to find out the status of my loan and was told that I was approved but the interest rate would now be 4.74 percent. There was NO immediate explanation given until I escalated my complaint to a manger who informed me that because my credit score was ONLY XXXX the interest rate was raised. I deem this to be deceptive business practices and blatantly just fraud. USAA Has refused to speak with the USAA Representative who quoted me 4.28 percent so as to verify that I was told my loan Rate was 4.28 percent.

2018-12-19,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/18, I attempted to make a mobile deposit in my checking account with XXXX. Because the amount exceeded the mobile deposit limit by {$340.00}, I called support and asked for an increase. They told me that they did not provide increases above the amount I had. They suggested I cash the check elsewhere. The mobile app gave instructions for deposit by mail. It listed two addresses, one was a PO BOX , and the other was for overnight delivery. I endorsed the check and mailed it out two-day priority mail to the overnight address. 

Using the tracking number, I discovered it was not delivered until Monday, rather than Friday as promised. On the app, the instructions for deposit by mail clearly state '' Once your check has been received, up to {$200.00} of your check deposit funds will generally be available within one business day. The remainder will generally be available after another business day. Check deposit amounts greater than {$5000.00} may be held for an extended period. '' So, I called on Tuesday, XX/XX/18, which was one business day after the date it was delivered since there was no indication that the check had been received. The agent I spoke with told me that she could not confirm receipt of the deposit, and she told me she could give me no time frame for how long it would take and that they would know it was deposited when it showed on my account. I asked could they not at least confirm it was received at the correct address. She told me that she could not. I asked what remedy I had and she assured me that it would be processed soon. 

I called today, XX/XX/18, a full two business days after they received it according to USPS, and the agent placed me on hold and told me that "" in her experience, it can take three business days before it is processed or shown in the account. '' I asked could she not confirm it with the processing center that the check was received so I don't have to worry that it was delivered to the incorrect address. She told me that she "" could not check with the processing center until 10 business days after the tracking number delivery date. '' So, I am going into XXXX without any access to my funds, and also without having any idea whether the check was received at the correct address. None of this information was available to me or I would not have deposited the check via mail. I expected to have access to part of the funds "" one business day after received '' as their app stated.

When I called back the person who immediately answered the phone did not state their name or the name of the company, she immediately said, thank you for holding. This was a cause for concern for me as usually when a call is answered at a business, the person answering the phone states the name of the business and their name, not thank you for holding especially when you were never on hold and had just dialed straight through. I asked the person who answered the call who they were and what was the nature of the call, she immediately asked me if the last 4 of my social was XXXX and if my date of birth was XXXX. I asked again who she was and the nature of the call and she refused to tell me who they were or the purpose of the call because I would not verify the last 4 of my social and date of birth. I explained to the person that I was not doing any of that and again asked who exactly this company was and what exactly the purpose of the call was regarding. Again the person stated that she was not able to do so unless I verified my personal information. I explained to the person that as far as I was concerned this could be a scam due to her lack of providing me the nature of the call, and more information regarding the company especially when this company was calling me at my place of employment with vague responses. The person yet again told me that she was not able to provide me any additional information without me first verifying my social security number and date of birth. My last statement to this person was that if in fact this was a personal business matter involving myself, that they needed to contact me on my personal cell number and not at my work number. The person asked me to verify my cell number to which my response was that if this was in fact anything dealing with me personally, and with them already utilizing my work number that they should obviously have my personal cell number. The person then stated that she would have my work number removed from their system. I've also attempted to visit the website that the robo call provided, however when utilizing the "" account number '' provided by the robo call, the system is still asking that my information be verified without any indication what this is in regards to.

On XX/XX/19 I rec 'd a notice from Equifax alerting me to a change on my credit report. I checked my report via my XXXX XXXX XXXX acct. and found that my address had been reverted to an old address for some unknown reason. I contacted the company because I was concerned. I had changed my address when I moved in XX/XX/2019. My banks and my credit cards had all been updated with my new address and it had been reflected on my credit report.

However, when I began a new job in XX/XX/2019 there was an incident that could have made my personal ID info. vulnerable - they emailed an I-9 form with all of my identifying info. via insecure lines. 

In any event when spoke to a some Equifax repXXXX in XXXX and explained my concern he said it was nothing to worry about and to ignore the alert. 

Sure enough on XX/XX/19 I received a second alert - checked my ount and found the same issue - my old address appearing as my current address. 

I called Equifax again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with someone named XXXX who said he would place a dispute on my credit report in an effort to remove the old address. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received the first of several emails saying that the dispute had been completed and offering me a confirmation number by which I could check the status of the dispute. I have tried several times to log onto the status check website offered by Equifax to no avail. When I provide my identifying information I receive an error notice saying the information does not match their records. 

I have spent the last hour on the phone trying to reach someone who can help me with this. The first person with whom I spoke transferred me to the "" dispute center '' where I spoke with a rep. named "" XXXX '' who asked me for my DOB, my address, info. about current credit cards and about past student loans ( which I paid off over 10 years ago ) and she was not satisfied. I then asked for a supervisor. She placed me on hold for over 10 minutes. I gave up and called back and reached XXXX. They transferred me to U.S. dispute dept. where I spoke with XXXX who said she would transfer me to a supervisor. I was placed on hold for over ten minutes and then disconnected. 

I called back again. Now speaking with XXXX - who said she was going to transfer me to a supervisor in the dispute department but after 15 minutes of hold time a customer service rep. in "" products and solutions '' picked up and had to transfer me again. 

I hung up. I want this issue cleared up. This company is a joke and has wasted my time and screwed up my report.

When I moved back to my home, I couldn't find a job with my, now-useless, degree and was so deflated for years with a degree that has no value and has cheated me of my self-worth. 

The remainder of the loan is now with Nelnet. First, it was with XXXX XXXX - they crashed & burned, then XXXX took over the loan and now this new company. It's very frustrating to find out that the loan has moved companies.

2018-12-21,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","I applied and received a mortgage with PNC in XX/XX/2017. I was told I HAD to have an escrow account with PNC. My first concern about PNC occurred when I had issues with my house insurance. I had received letters from my insurance company that the insurance payment was due. First I paid the insurance and then I contacted PNC. PNC advised me PNC would sent the payment via regular US mail. The insurance company finally received PNC 's payment. Then the insurance company sent my payment back. I am used to making electronic payments before the due date. I believe PNC should do the same. To me this issue was scary. And it really annoyed me when PNC explained there was a 1 month grace period so I had nothing to worry about. 

My new issue occurred in XXXX and it is how PNC collects my escrow. PNC overcharged me {$1100.00} in escrow and sent me a check. In my opinion, PNC had an interest free loan. Then PNC is going to increase my escrow account. So I contacted PNC and requested that they apply the check to my escrow account which will lower my escrow payment. PNC said no. 

It bothers me that I had to pay my insurance and escrow PNC 's way. PNC 's business model makes gives them an interest free loan. To me there is no incentive to be fair to the mortgagee.",,PNC Bank N.A.,VA,224XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-21,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3107166
2019-06-24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","XX/XX/2016 I received a letter from Ditech stating my mortgage payment has not been received, thankfully for me I keep very good records and at the time I was paying via money order because I was not going to pay their ridiculous fee of {$12.00} to pay online. I called Ditech and let them know I paid my mortgage and I don't understand what the problem is. They told me I had to go to the business where I purchased the money and get proof which cost me {$24.00} on top of the late fee they were trying to charge me. After so many phone calls and broken promises from the incompetent people that work at Ditech I was able to get the situation taken care of weeks or months later. Come to find out they applied my payment to someone else 's account. The next thing that really broke the camels back was when I received a notice in the mail XX/XX/2016 from Ditech stating they paid my taxes which are not escrowed, we pay out of pocket every year. I called them and told them to take their money off so I could pay my taxes, they refused stating I was delinquent on my taxes. In my County our taxes are not due until XX/XX/XXXX so again Ditech was messing with my account information once again, they stated they inadvertently entered our account and paid our taxes when it should have been another members account. I was promised a letter of resolution and a call to our county treasurer to reverse the payment off so I could pay my taxes. After all this time we are now being sued for the tax payment and being threatened by the collection agency working with these losers. Please do not do business with this incompetent company. Customer service has no clue what is going on and they are extremely rude. Needless to say after the tax incident I went with a credit union in my hometown and have not had one single problem with them.

You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal XXXX portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required XXXX of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting XXXX XXXX  into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the XXXX, FCRA, XXXX PRIVACY RULE, XXXX, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


XXXX ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of XXXX XXXX statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


XXXX ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity XXXX XXXX XXXX that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,117XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3376646

I used Chase Bank ATM located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NY. The check was accepted and I was informed that the funds will be available in my account on XX/XX/2018. I reside in XXXX, XXXX and had a scheduled flight from NY to XXXX. I returned to XXXX on XX/XX/2018. Later, I found that the check was not accepted due to ATM/deposit Error. In an effort to resolve the issue, I contacted Chase Bank via phone multiple times. The call center representatives came up with contradictory information every time. The details of my telephonic correspondence with chase is presented in an attached table. 

Finally, I traveled to New York on XX/XX/2018 to resolve this problem. I visited Chase Bank branch in the XXXX and personally met a banker on XX/XX/2018 to get a clearer picture. Even the banker in the branch was unable to help me and was astonished that they are unable to trace the original check. They suggested sending a copy of the check to the address of the party who wrote the check ( address was printed on the check ). I was informed that I shall have to wait 8-days for the check to be delivered to that address in NY. According to the banker, I must have received the copy of the check and updates about the problem much earlier. But even after the passage of around 3-weeks, the fate of this transaction in unknown. 

This ATM error and further mismanagement due to false and contradictory information presented by Chase Bank call centers has caused me a lot of mental and financial distress. I had to put my payments on hold resulting in accrued late payment fines from the creditors as well as loss of trust. It will also negatively impact my credit score. I had to travel to NY at the recommendation of the Chase Call Center representatives and the banker in the Chase Branch. And I am adding to my costs by staying in NY and waiting to receive updates from Chase. I request that either the check be returned to me promptly, or the amount be deposited in my account immediately. Further, I demand Chase Bank to compensate me for the financial and mental distress caused by their mishandling of the transaction as well as reimburse me for my stay in NY and travel between New York and XXXX.

My XXXX credit card was activated XX/XX/XXXX with a limit of {$1200.00} the credit card usage was stopped at approx. {$730.00} for non-payment ( being 3 months in arrears ) in XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately contacted XXXX ( in XXXX XXXX ), knowing I never purchased {$1300.00} worth of merchandise, requesting statements with purchase information for the months of XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX of XXXX but I was told MCM bought my account ( XX/XX/XXXX ) & they no longer had that information but MCM has a Recovery Dept that can send the information I request. I then contacted MCM and MCM 's Recovery Dept. ( XX/XX/XXXX ), requested information for purchases made from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. They sort-of complied, I was mailed XXXX statements "" starting from '' XX/XX/XXXX, INSTEAD, with the beginning balance of {$1300.00} balance leading up to {$1800.00}. I have attached a copy of these statements : XXXX-MCM.pdf ( please be advised that this is not what I asked for ). Needless to say this was not what I requested and oddly the statement showed a previous {$0.00} balance, interest and late fees for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Within the same month ( of XXXX. ) I filed the a dispute with XXXX, requesting MCM to show proof of purchases. I received no reply. I called XXXX XXXX  Consumer Dept ( I'm not sure if that's the right name ) & was suggested to contact XXXX and XXXX ( who owns XXXX accounts ) for a resolve but upon contacting them again I got same answer from both.. "" my account was sold to MCM and they had all the account information '', I'd have to contact MCM. I filed a 2nd dispute In XX/XX/XXXX, with the same request, and in XX/XX/XXXX the 3rd & last dispute was for MCM to show purchases "" prior to '' the {$1300.00} balance, leading up to that balance and accrued fees that total {$1800.00}! XX/XX/XXXX, MCM 's letter reply was ; "" ... we sent the information you requested and we don't understand what you are disputing. Send a letter with your request or contact us. '' Are they playing games? They had not sent what I asked for & numerous times I disputed them requesting time & time again with no resolve! During XXXX credit cards were being breached ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX & XXXX ) and I strongly feel, unless MCM is fibbing about what I owe, at that time I may have been a victim of credit card theft. This is why I'm requesting proof of purchases. It's unfair to charge & make me pay for a thieves debt. In XXXX my XXXX XXXX credit card was breached and used while I was in the store & he checked out the same time I did just one register over!! If the Customer Svc. Department at XXXX XXXX hadn't compared the time & purchase on my receipt to the thief 's, I'd been held liable for that crooks purchase ( s ). 

I have also noticed actions taken by CFPB in XXXX against this company for trying to collect on debts using deceptive tactics. For example : 1-Attempted to collect on unsubstantiated or inaccurate debt : ... ..balances that sellers claimed were approximate or that otherwise did not reflect the correct amount owed by the consumer ... .Some sellers also represented that documents were not available for some of the accounts .... '' 2-XXXX XXXX  Associates falsely claimed an attorney had reviewed the file and a lawsuit was imminent : The companys collectors, who identified themselves as from the Litigation Department, misrepresented to consumers that litigation against them was planned, imminent, or even underway. In reality, in many cases, an attorney had not reviewed the account and the company had not decided whether to file suit. The list goes on and on about these heinous practices and I strongly feel this is happening to me now!! 

Now, early XX/XX/XXXX, I received a FINAL NOTICE ( please see attached FINALMCM.pdf ) from MCM threatening me with lawyers, court and garnishing my wages and bank account ( Example 2 ). I never even received what I asked for and now they're moving forward with actions against me to hurt my livelihood and to damage my credit?

2019-02-26,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"This complaint is against Wells Fargo. 

My credit card with Wells Fargo was hacked and {$7000.00} of fraudulent charges were made on it starting in XXXX of 2018. The established pattern of banking consisted of 2-3 transactions per month, simply transferring funds from the credit card to my checking account in large dollar amounts ; typically {$2000.00} to {$3000.00} at a time ; as I managed cash flow. This pattern was in process for approximately 12 months. When the account was hacked, there were suddenly dozens of transactions per day in small dollar amounts made to XXXX and XXXX accounts. 

Wells Fargo failed to notice the unusual account activity and when I discovered the problem and brought it to the attention of their fraud department, they took no responsibility for the problem and refused to reimburse me for the stolen funds. They stated in a letter that since I had paid my bill, that I automatically accept all charges made on the account. This is unacceptable negligence and the poorest customer care I can imagine.

My complaints are the following : 1. Wells Fargo does not seem to have an effective system in place to detect unusual account activity or bank fraud.

2. Wells Fargo does not bear responsibility for failing to secure their customers bank accounts when they are compromised.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,956XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3163768

Then these same debt buyers that used to be known as collection agencies could re-assign the debt to a fourth party for collection enforcement. This process of stating that debts are being purchased by a third party and then enforced by a fourth party is the larges scam in America. The U. S. Supreme Court decision in XX/XX/2017 known as XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is responsible for this scam. This decision basically states that since a third party purchases the debt, that my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is VOID. The problem is that almost all unsecured debts are sold off to Wall Street in various traunces in securitized trusts. There simply is no resolution where the debt can be purchased, only that the debt can be assigned for collection purposes. Each financial institution must file a 10Q filing quarterly with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The rules on debts being charged off is with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through the FDIC Act, Code 5000. A debt can be classified either standard or sub-standard. Debts over 180 days late must go into the sub-standard category and written off on a quarterly 10Q SEC filing. These charge 0ffs usually are submitted in the tens of millions of dollars. So its virtually for these debts to be sold..period. Accordingly, I request full validation proving the debt purchase. Secondly, I will entertain a very low settlement agreement to put my dispute to rest. All of the settlements can be submitted through the CFPB portal email address submitted.

Most credit card companies, upon being notified, have immediately canceled the card and refunded the fraudulent charges. 

Bank of America, on the other hand, has refused to cancel the charges, claiming since the card was physically present, I am responsible. 

My Bank of America credit card had never been used in the previous 5 years, and yet, upon being used for a number of charges, no fraud alert or notification was sent to me. I personally noticed the charges when I was billed, and immediately notified Bank of America. 

During Bank of America 's investigation they noticed there was another phone number on my account, but they could not identify where that phone number came from. Was it used to activate the stolen card, or did someone else have access to my account? The only thing they claimed was since the card was physically present ( obviously, since it was stolen ), I was liable for those charges, which was a total of {$53.00}. 

As far as I can tell, Bank of America is unable to adequately protect its clients accounts and also unable to adequately investigate fraudulent charges. I have since closed my account, but am looking to get those fraudulent charges dismissed. 

My credit report shows that I normally have thousands of dollars of revolving debt every month, all of which is paid on time.

2017-06-30,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Unable to receive car title or other problem after the loan is paid off,"We obtained a boat loan in XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX XXXX based in XXXX, TX who is now defunct. The loan was transferred to Volvo Car Finance North America. The loan was paid off in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I need to sell or give the boat and trailer to charity and need a clear title to the trailer.The Virginia DMV will not give me a clear title because the title is registered to XXXX. I have called the XXXX number listed on a bill from XX/XX/XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX and have not gotten any results. Volvo will give me a no interest letter, but it does not explain how Volvo obtained the loan and where is XXXX. DMV will not give me a title without that explanation & Volvo refuses to do so. They claim they never heard of XXXX, do n't know how they got the loan ... But we paid our money to XXXX for years, so obviously if we had been in default they would have found a title to sell it with. My last 2 contacts in XX/XX/XXXX have been with a XXXX and a XXXX at the phone number listed on the bill. Every time I call I may get a call center in Tennessee or Nebraska. I spoke to those 2 in Tennessee because the 2 release letters I did get were from the address listed in complaint form. The following is what the VA DMV needs for me to get the title '' Submit evidence to DMV that a lien release can not be obtained from the lienholder due to the lender going out of business, merging with, or being taken over by another business, along with evidence that the lien has been satisfied. Evidence of lien satisfaction may include, but is not limited to the following : For lenders that are merged with, or taken over by another company/corporation/or lender, customer must include a lien release for the vehicle from the company/corporation/or lender with whom merged and supporting documentation linking the original lienholder with the merged or takeover lender. "" DMV further explained : "" Volvo Car Finance should be able to provide documentation of when they took over the lien or when they merged with the old lienholder or bought the company. If they ca n't provide that documentation, have them provide you a signed and dated letter on company letterhead stating that they are unable to provide the documentation of when or how the lien was acquired ''. My problem is that Volvo refuses to explain this. I can call them and give them the VIN number, my name & address and without so much as batting an eye, they will give me a release letter. How can they do that without knowing if they have a vested interest in the boat? But to get them to write how they acquired the loan, etc, they will not do. I have faxed to XXXX my supporting letter, my trailer registration, and a copy of the monthly bill from XX/XX/XXXX. That last occurred on XX/XX/XXXX to the fax number XXXX. I have heard nothing from XXXX or XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. I need that title to the trailer as I am moving and wish to sell it or give it to charity. It has to move.

I am unsure which addresses these people cunningly re-direct my mail to for so many years. This applies all the American Express Cards. CEOs of the American Express card company refused to close all accounts that links to my name and Social Security Numbers since year XXXX. I can prove it, please see attached. For the last 8-9 years, my sibblings and their friends ILLEGALLY use my Social Security numbers to commit Credit Card Frauds especially American Express cards and Mail Thefts. They refused to pay the bills and insisted on saying the Credit Cards are not under their name. I found out from the court house that American Express card company did tried to sue me however I did NOT receive any subpoenas because my sibblings and their friends committed Mail Thefts and Mail Frauds. I do NOT know who impostered me that day in court. But the case was Dismissed without prejudice. And from what I heard from my sibblings, an ILLEGAL deal was made to put me in debts that don't belong to me and to put my Elderly parents in debts as well. CEOs of the American Express card company "" created, printed out and ILLEGALLY distribute physical American Express Credit Cards in suspicious NUMEROUS AMOUNTS for 2 specific companies to pay for their daily breakfast, dinners in XXXX XXXX, CA etc. These people SCHEMED to expect me to be responsible for their bills especially when they FALSIFIED me to be a "" Philanthropist '' and even continues when they put me XXXX in year XXXX.

When I received a letter from XXXX in the mail asking for payment, I was shocked and made the payment as soon as I could.

I was trying to retrieve funds the week after when I noticed that the account was blocked. I immediately called said banking institution, CAPITAL ONE 360, concerned asking for details on my blocked account. Several questions were asked to confirm my identity. Everything was confirmed, then they explained the matter. I wasnt aware of what was going on, or what was done. They then flipped the script and tried to blame me for the security risk. They victimized me and played the blame game. I then asked for my banking relationship to be terminated, which they happily agreed to. I asked to have all incoming deposits made to the account blocked off while they still investigate, which they agreed to since I get my direct deposit to this account. CAPITAL ONE 360 is still allowing my funds to go into the hacked account. My employer cant stop any deposits into the account until they can confirm with the bank.

2019-02-19,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card,"This is the timeline of the events : 1. XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX., charge of {$86.00} with my XXXX XXXX at a Restaurant XXXX XXXX XXXX, Washington D.C. 

2. My cycle ends day 4 of every month. Upon receiving my monthly statement in XXXX, I noticed that this charge changed to exactly twice the amount : {$170.00}. I disputed the amount online. 

3. On XX/XX/XXXX I was given a PERMANENT credit for {$86.00}. Citi case # XXXX. 

3. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received in the regular mail a letter from Citi, Dispute Department, signed by XXXX XXXX, Service Specialist, Phone XXXX, email : XXXX asking for supporting information of my dispute, and saying : "" ... if we don't hear from you by XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 days upon receiving this letter ), we'll investigate with the information we have available, and the conditional credit may be reversed ''. 

4. Same date ( this was in the evening after I got home from my office ) I called customer services, explained the situation and expressed surprise for the letter and time frame given to answer the letter and provide supporting documents, considering that I already received an email confirming the permanent resolution of the dispute, and the information online, in the dispute center, indicated that the dispute has been permanently resolved. The customer service person agrees with me, that he was also looking at the same information on his screen. Nevertheless, he transferred my call to the dispute center. 

5. XXXX XXXX was not available, but the person who answered the phone said that it was strange that I got an email, that they ONLY inform about dispute resolution by regular mail. She dismissed my observation about the two days given in the letter to provide information, and said that I could scan my receipt and sent it to the email above, as well as a scanned copy of the form. I play along, and I did so, sending an email the same night at XXXX XXXX 

6. The following day, I called the restaurant, explain the situation, and they apologizes for the mistake. They offered to give me the credit on the spot, but I explained that I had already a conditional credit from citi, and to avoid confusions, it would be better to follow their process. They agree and stated that as soon as they receive the phone call from citi, they would confirm that there was an error. 

7. On XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX, I receive an email from Citi ( reminder, the dispute center said they do not communicate by email the resolution of a dispute ( sic ) ), indicating that my dispute has been resolved. Happily, I signed on my account online ( as I did when in XX/XX/XXXX they already told me that the dispute was permanently resolved in my favor ), and to my surprise, I found an electronic letter saying that : "" after reviewing the dispute and the information you provided, we're unable to resolve the dispute in you favor ... ''. I was really surprised, considering that I send them a copy of my receipt that I signed in the restaurant, and the fact that the restaurant already agrees on the mistake ( you can not refute a hard copy proof ). 

8. I immediately called customer services and explained the situation, and asked for the right instance to file a formal complaint and a resolution of the problem. The person on the phone was also surprised. He gave me a PO Box for the "" Office of the President '', for XXXX in South Dakota. He also offered me a {$100.00} credit for being a "" loyal customer '' ( I have a Citi AA Visa card since XXXX, which was arbitrary changed to a MC in XXXX ). I told him that I was grateful for that, but this was an issue of principles. There is a mistake and citi has to fixed and acknowledge it in writing. 

9. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I called the restaurant again. They were surprised by the action taken by Citi, they said that Citi NEVER called them. XXXX, in charge of accounting, gave me on the spot a credit for the amount. She entered the transaction manually in the system, and she was kind enough to send me a scanned copy of the receipts. That transaction was recognized in the system only on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

10. I have copy of all documents, receipts, emails, etc., described above. After doing some research in the internet, I realized that there are many similar complaints, handled by the "" Office oft the President '',  without much success. But at the same time, I "" discover '' the existence of your office, and I decided to send my complaint to you instead. It is very difficult for Citi to be a fair judge of what has happened, and a third neutral party is better suited to clarify this issue, and avoid future occurrences to other consumers, by "" encouraging '' Citi to improve their internal coordination, particularly in such a critical unit as the Dispute Center. 

I believe, because of negligence and wrong doing from Citi despite the evidence provided as requested, some action is needed. In the best case scenario, this is not a systemic behavior, but a problem with the staff managing disputes, which is also bad, and should be of public interest to avoid repetition of this behavior with other customers. Thanks for you kind attention to this complaint and please, let me know if I can be of any help.

2019-02-07,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"I called Bank of America as I noticed I was being charged a $ XXXX   monthly maintenance fee on my personal checking account. The customer service rep advised that the fee was correct based on the type of account I had. He then retracted his statement to say that he provided the wrong information in error as they were using a new tool called XXXX XXXX. He then stated that based on the product I have theres certain criteria and thresholds to help avoid fees. One of the criteria was to maintain at least a {$2000.00} average daily balance in my savings account. There was several months of which I met this criteria, however Ive continued to be accessed with this {$14.00} fee for several years. The customer service rep proceeded to advise me that since I was just notifying them of the error that there was nothing I could do to be refunded for the bank error. I asked to speak with a supervisor and the representative advised that the only option was to request a callback. After insisting that a callback was not acceptable, the customer service rep returned to the call and stated I had the option to wait on a supervisor but the industry has moved away from that option asa whole. I then spoke with a supervisor after being on the phone for approximately 1 hour. My conversation with XXXX XXXX ( supervisor )  lasted for another hour. She assured me that the bank doesnt make errors and that I had not met the criteria. I requested that she pull my monthly statements as I was currently looking at them on the BOA app and it showed I had met the criteria for multiple months. She then downloaded the statements to see that I was correct. She placed me on hold and returned to agree to waive 6 months worth of fees as I had met the criteria however she advised it was still my error as my accounts werent linked based on a solutions based option that would have been offered to me years ago. I asked when was this offered and she stated the bank doesnt keep any documentation beyond 7 years. She then proceeded to say that I must dispute any fee errors within 60 fats of the errror and that they would only go back 1 year. I asked since I have fees in error dating back for more than 1 year, what could I do for a solution?

2019-02-18,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I have a Fidelity credit card. On the card was mostly a charge for my son 's college bill of approximately {$9500.00}. The entire credit card bill was {$9800.00}. I had money in my son 's educational account to pay most of the bill and was assisted by someone at Fidelity to transfer this money over to the credit card account. A small amount of additional money was needed from his account for which I sold a bond. This was not going to be credited until XX/XX/XXXX. I had other means to pay the bill but wanted to pay directly from my son 's account for tax reasons. The Fidelity representative told me not to be concerned because the credit card withdrawals were never made on the due date. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I kept an eye on the account and called Fidelity to check on whether or not the credit card withdrawal was being made ; there was no alert from the credit card department, which is a separate company, about an upcoming payment. The Fidelity representative told me that if there was to be a transfer it would have shown up. By the last time I checked at XXXX XXXX  there was still no alert so I assumed everything was all set. Several weeks later i got a notice that none of the bill was paid. I called them and was told that the payment hit in the middle of the night despite there being no notification during the business day. Instead of taking what was available, they took nothing and charged me a large fee for nonpayment. Even though all the money was in the account for the payment by XX/XX/XXXX the money was left untouched and no one notified me of the problem. Is there a law that was violated requiring the credit card company and/or the bank to give a heads up by the end of the business day that money would be pulled from my account that night? The payment went through so everything looked right with the account but it was rejected on XX/XX/XXXX. I feel taken advantage of ; there was no way to get this straightened out despite all my efforts. 

In summary, the credit card company should have provided a heads up the day that the money was to be withdrawn so I would have known and paid a different way. There must be a law about this because I have always received such alerts in transactions of this type. Given the lack of notification, the credit card company should have withdrawn the funds on the XXXX. By then the money would have been in the account. Plus they had my phone number ; obviously I was trying to pay the bill since most of the money was available for the payment. They should have at least applied that money. In fact some of the money was cashed in rewards from the credit card itself. Not even that was applied.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,MA,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3155378

My finance company which is XXXX XXXX   financed me for a little over 15,000 $ for my car. I only purchased the vehicle because I was trying to start building my credit to buy a home next year. Ive been making my payment ON time since I have had the car. But received nothing but poor customer service and attitude. I was recently hurt on the job XX/XX/XXXX and was out of work for 4 months. Still making every payment on time all to find out that XX/XX/XXXX was the LAST time they reported my payments to the Credit bureau Transunion. My payment is due twice a month with the amount of XXXX. $ bi weekly. I noticed my credit score didnt really go up and I also have 2 credit cards that I pay on time every month. So this last time I made my payment last Wednesday I asked the agent who took the payment how come my credit score hasnt went up from making my payments on time she then expressed to me that their system has been down since XX/XX/XXXX. I was disappointed because Ive been working so hard to build my credit all for them to not be reporting and didnt even reach out to customers to let them know whats going on. They was trying to be sneaky and got very hostile when I told her I would have to report this to the credit company and another 3rd party to get this resolved. The agent couldnt tell me an exact date on when their System would be back running. Once I contacted Transunion they expressed to me that no credit report was given to them since XXXX of XXXX this is very unacceptable and I would like to take further action. This finance company doesnt even allow you to make late payments or your car wont start and they will repo it. So for their policy to be so Strick they should be on top of things and follow the rules and regulations as well! I will never recommend anybody to finance with this company XXXX XXXX they are a rip off and have high interest fees and very very unprofessional and on top of that they dont even offer gap insurance which is a very significant perk to purchasing a car.

We wrote a detailed letter to the Caliber Escrow Dept. seeking elimination of PMI ( complying with their required BPO house value estimate, at a {$100.00} cost to us ) and also requesting elimination of our escrow ( we had done this with our previous house with XXXX XXXX because of similar problems ). We never received direct answers to these inquiries in our letter. We have repeatedly been given the run around, or canned answers that don't answer our questions. We are current on the loan and have never been even a single day late with our payment. 

Tired of the escrow abuse. This happened with our last house ( XXXX XXXX ) and is happening again with Caliber Home Loans. Currently, they are in receipt of {$2000.00} they initially paid to XXXX for home insurance ( they paid them but XXXX returned it because we paid it along with our auto insurance ). We believed we would be able to eliminate the escrow and pay taxes and insurance ourself. Also the PMI should be eliminated based on our paying {$100.00} for a BPO estimate. This of course ties into the escrow. If we pay insurance -- and we didn't even request reimbursement from the escrow for the {$450.00} flood insurance after Harvey we already paid for -- then without PMI too, the escrow amount should be around {$700.00} per month not close to {$1000.00} as it is now ( taxes of about {$8300.00} ). What is Caliber doing? Pooling everyone 's escrow to their benefit. There is no reason the {$11000.00} should sit in an escrow account without earning interest, especially when their calculation of the escrow is wrong.

Caliber from day one has gotten their end of the bargain -- timely mortgage payments of principal, interest and escrow. Also after Harvey we have maintained both homeowner 's and flood insurance. Now, we simply want the escrow to reflect accurately the account or, preferably, be eliminated as we are able to easily pay the year end taxes.",,"Caliber Home Loans, Inc.",TX,774XX,,Consent provided,Web,2019-02-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3156656

Some of the violations include:
§ 806.  Harassment or abuse 
A debt collector may not engage in any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:
 (5) Causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number.

§ 807.  False or misleading representations
A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:
 (2) The false representation of --
(A) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt; or
 (4) The representation or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of any person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment, or sale of any property or wages of any person unless such action is lawful and the debt collector or creditor intends to take such action.
(5) The threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.
 (7) The false representation or implication that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct in order to disgrace the consumer.
(10) The use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.

§ 809.  Validation of debts
(a) Notice of debt; contents
Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing --
(1) the amount of the debt;
(2) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;
(3) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector;
(4) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector; and
(5) a statement that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.
(b) Disputed debts
If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection (a) of this section that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. Collection activities and communications that do not otherwise violate this subchapter may continue during the 30-day period referred to in subsection (a) unless the consumer has notified the debt collector in writing that the debt, or any portion of the debt, is disputed or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor. Any collection activities and communication during the 30-day period may not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumer’s right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor.
(c) Admission of liability
The failure of a consumer to dispute the validity of a debt under this section may not be construed by any court as an admission of liability by the consumer.
(d) Legal pleadings
A communication in the form of a formal pleading in a civil action shall not be treated as an initial communication for purposes of subsection (a).

Section 605B states : ( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter. 

Approximately XX/XX/2019, I noticed ten inquiries on my file that I did not authorize. I called Transunion immediately to inform them of the fraudulent inquiries.

On XX/XX/2018 I went to to XXXX XXXX practice for a XXXX  and XXXX covered by my insurance. While in her XXXX  chair she solicited me and convinced me to replace my XXXX with a XXXX  by offering me financing at 0 % for 5 years. She told me I was approved and immediately continue to work in my XXXX. During the middle of the procedure while XXXX XXXX  She came back with papers for me to sign. She never told me it was a credit card and never gave me any document with the terms and conditions. 
3 weeks later I received a credit card for {$7000.00} from Synchrony Bank/Carecredit for 26.99 % ( which she already depleted within minutes of being in the XXXX  chair. ) .Surprised at getting a credit card in the mail, I immediately contacted Synchrony bank to dispute the charge interest rate. Synchrony Bank/carecredit advised me to contact the vendor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  which I did. After several calls to her office, her customer representative told me that they have contacted Synchrony Bank/carecredit to make the adjustment to reflect 0 % for 5 years. Several calls to Synchrony revealed that to date XXXX XXXX had not called Synchrony to have this information regarding the interest rate adjustment or corrected, Which lead me to believe that XXXX XXXX had been engage in bait and switch to receive and use the funds to her advantage causing me financial, physical, emotional, mental stress and anxiety. Its been over 5 months of pain and suffering because of the poor job she did on my XXXX  causing me to go to Urgent care twice as a result of her damage. I have been unable to sleep at night because of the anxiety and stress associated with the interest rate of this card and fear of seeing another XXXX  and possibility of filing bankruptcy. As a widow, I never would accept or even apply for a card that is 26.99 %. This XXXX was unnecessary because my XXXX  was ok. The only reason I accepted her offer was because she told me her financing is at 0 % for 5 years. 
I am disappointed that Synchrony bank would take side with the crocked XXXX who will eventually force me to file bankruptcy because of XXXX XXXX unethical and fraudulent behavior. I still can not believe that within minutes XXXX XXXX duped me out of a total {$15000.00} that included what my insurance covered and {$7000.00} from Synchrony bank. Despite the several calls to synchrony bank and to XXXX XXXX office to get this matter resolved I am yet to get justice. On XX/XX/2018 XXXX, a manager ay Synchrony bank told me he would reverse the interest rate to 0 % for 60 months. A month later i got a letter from Synchrony bank reversing that decison and was told that XXXX XXXX has to call in and make the changes. XXXX XXXX  representative from XXXX customer relations ( XXXX ) told me she called Synchrony bank to correct the problem. Synchrony Bank says they never receive a call from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX office.

2019-03-26,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"on XX/XX/XXXX, My husband and I went to look at a used car from a dealer we have dealt with three times now. We drove that car away that day. The dealer advised he now uses US Auto Credit for lending and someone would be calling me to do a quick identity interview. This was done on XX/XX/XXXX as I have an email confirming I did this call. Prior to this I rec 'd collection calls to make my first payment which I learned was on XX/XX/XXXX before I even completed the interview and frankly didn't even know US Auto Credit was the finance company as the dealer just stated he uses a auto loan company now and we  didn't know the name. Since XX/XX/XXXX the dealership has had to replace the 45 day temp tag on my car several times ( over 125 days total now ) bc the Auto Credit company despite the dealer collecting {$400.00} for my tags and taxes has failed to provide me a tag or registration for my vehicle. I have made every payment until my payment due on XX/XX/XXXX until they provide me my tag, if they don't then the car will be going back to the dealer if I cant get it resolved here and subsequently removed from my credit and a refund of all payments made to the Auto Credit including taxes and tags will be returned even if I have to seek legal counsel assuming it cant be resolved here. Of note, I have had this vehicle insured since I drove it away on XX/XX/XXXX as a safety precaution for myself and my family and I will upload proof as well as proof that I have paid for the tags and taxes.",,U.S. Auto Credit Corporation,SC,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-03-26,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3191298

She even promised to email me, and gave me a confirmation number of XXXX. I was NEVER called or emailed. I still do not have a Equifax credit score.

I previously filed a complaint w/ CFPB Complaint Number XXXX. Amex 's response failed to address the complaint at issue -- the prorated annual fee for the three weeks that it tricked me into keeping my acct open for an investigation it now admits it never conducted. 

On or around XXXX XXXX, I called Amex to close my account for which I was charged {$95.00} for the next year 's annual fee. I inquired about a promotion bonus that I was owed from a year ago. Amex rep XXXX XXXX confirmed that I met the terms for the bonus miles ID Dispute XXXX. He put notes on acct. XXXX stated that he's also including {$95.00} annual fee in the dispute to be waived. 

While the promotion dispute was being reviewed ( Amex now admits that it lied twice about investigating this ), I asked Amex to change the card to one w/o an no annual fee but Amex warned that bonus miles might not be credited. Amex advised that I have to keep the card as Delta Gold. My  concern was that if I don't close the card within 30d of the annual fee charge, Amex won't ever credit it. Amex XXXX assured me that it would be credited when the XXXX bonus miles are credited. 

Amex now admits that for the second time, it LIED about investigating my dispute. While it was supposed to investigate, Amex tricked me into keeping the acct open which I tried to close or convert to a no-annual-fee card.
