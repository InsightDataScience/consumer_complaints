Summary
The consumer_complaints.py script reads the input file per line and creates a dictionary to get the result file containig the following:
1. product (name should be written in all lowercase)
2. year
3. total number of complaints received for that product and year
4. total number of companies receiving at least one complaint for that product and year
5. highest percentage (rounded to the nearest whole number) of total complaints filed against one company for that product and year. Use standard rounding conventions (i.e., Any percentage between 0.5% and 1%, inclusive, should round to 1% and anything less than 0.5% should round to 0%)

Steps to run:

To execute the script move to the main directory of the project and run the following in the terminal:

    python3.7 ./src/consumer_complaints.py ./input/complaints.csv ./output/report.csv
    
Last two arguments should be input and output files, respectively. You can see two files in the output folder report.csv and error_logfile.txt

Alternatively, you can also execute ./run.sh script to run the codes.
